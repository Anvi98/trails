        "content": "\nSouth Africa is currently facing a cri\ufffdcal situa\ufffdon in its power genera\ufffdon landscape, which is plagued by frequent power outages and the need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. This period emphasizes the importance of having firm-dispatchable power to balance out the intermitent nature of wind and solar energy sources. The paper proposes to repurpose old coal-fired power plants to generate firm-dispatchable energy in line with the principles of a Just Transi\ufffdon. Eskom's coal plants are approaching the end of their economic life, and their declining energy availability factor is becoming a challenge in mee\ufffdng the country's energy needs. The study suggests that a comprehensive strategy that integrates wind, solar, and firm-dispatchable power can be cost-effec\ufffdve and reliable compared to the tradi\ufffdonal coal-based approach or the nuclear alterna\ufffdve. The study emphasizes the necessity of a 25-\nyear plan that would invest in flexible and modular dispatchable genera\ufffdon. It also highlights the strategic loca\ufffdon of this genera\ufffdng capacity, including repurposing decommissioned coal plant sites. The proposed model integrates private investment, adheres to established best prac\ufffdces, and emphasizes adaptability to changing demand dynamics. The study provides a roadmap for enabling firm-dispatchable capacity for South Africa's energy transi\ufffdon, emphasizing economic prudence, environmental sustainability, and alignment with the principles of the Just Transi\ufffdon program. \n"

        "content": "\nSouth Africa is shi\ufffding from a power genera\ufffdon system that relies on fossil fuels to one based on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. This transi\ufffdon is mo\ufffdvated by the need to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and is also becoming a more cost-effec\ufffdve op\ufffdon (Creamer, 2023). \n\nFurthermore, the government has stated that this transi\ufffdon should be carried out within the framework of the Just Transi\ufffdon program where the transi\ufffdon is done in a manner that preserves employment in affected areas (Govt of South Africa, 2023).  \nWind and solar energy sources are known for their variability, so there must be a provision of firmdispatchable power to meet the demand when these sources cannot. A program for firm-dispatchable power must be implemented to successfully transi\ufffdon to a renewable energy system that relies on variable sources (Clark & McGregor, 2024). South Africa's current genera\ufffdon system is not mee\ufffdng its needs, and the situa\ufffdon will likely worsen as base load facili\ufffdes con\ufffdnue to age and must be replaced. This review summarises the current genera\ufffdon system and considers the implementa\ufffdon of the necessary firmdispatchable genera\ufffdon system. Repurposing current baseload coal genera\ufffdon plants as poten\ufffdal loca\ufffdons for developing firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon facili\ufffdes is proposed. \n"

        "content": "\nEskom is the sole electricity provider in South Africa, genera\ufffdng most of its power from fi\ufffdeen coal-fired plants that operate constantly (Eskom, n.d.). As of 2023, the average age of these plants was 36 years. \n\nAccording to interna\ufffdonal experience, coal-fired power plants usually have an average maximum economic lifespan of 46 years (Cui et al., 2019). Eskom plans their plants to last for 50 years, so many of them are nearing the end of their useful lives and will soon need to be decommissioned (Department of Energy, 2011). Of the 39.8 GW total of installed coal-fired plants, Eskom an\ufffdcipates decommissioning 28 GW in the next 15 years and nearly 35 GW in the next 25 years, as illustrated in Figure 1 (Futuregrowth Asset Management, 2021). It has been observed globally that thermal plants have a decreasing average capacity factor as they get older. This factor is called the Energy Availability Factor (EAF) in South Africa. In the last two decades, the EAF for the South African genera\ufffdon fleet has decreased from 80% to 53%, as indicated in Figure 2 (Pierce \n& le Roux, 2023). The Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) created since 2010 assumed an increase the EAF of these plants to meet growing energy demands (Department of Energy, 2019). However, experience has shown that this is unlikely to happen, and the fleet's performance will con\ufffdnue to decline un\ufffdl each plant becomes financially unviable. A study conducted in the USA by the Na\ufffdonal Energy Technology Laboratory \n(NETL), which analysed the performance of over 300 coal plants in the USA, has shown that the performance of ageing plants declines just as experienced by the South African fleet, as illustrated in Figure \n3 (Kern, 2015). \n\n \nIt is important to note that older power plants face numerous challenges in addi\ufffdon to maintaining their performance. They also produce harmful pollutants during coal combus\ufffdon, which can cause serious health problems to people exposed to power sta\ufffdon emissions (Bloomberg, 2023). To address this issue, significant modifica\ufffdons are required to reduce pollu\ufffdon, which can be expensive. However, due to the need for power genera\ufffdon and the high cost of these modifica\ufffdons, most of the Eskom plants have been granted exemp\ufffdons from installing the required pollu\ufffdon control (Bloomberg, 2023). In the latest proposed IRP, more exemp\ufffdons have been requested (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, \n2024). These license-to-operate concerns may ul\ufffdmately lead to some non-compliant plants being forced to shut down before they reach their expected 50-year lifespan. \n\nSouth Africa has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Accord, as have most other countries worldwide (UNFCCC, 2015). As part of the South African government's plan, the country has commited to phasing out coal-fuelled power plants to meet these commitments \n(UNFCCC, n.d.). In addi\ufffdon to the economic reasons for discon\ufffdnuing the use of these aging facili\ufffdes, mee\ufffdng these commitments will also put pressure on the country to decommission these plants and replace them with low or zero greenhouse gas-emi\ufffdng sources of electricity. While recognising the need to close out the large coal fuelled genera\ufffdon plants, the government is cognisant of the effect that these plants closure will have on local employment (Govt of South Africa, 2023). These plants are major sources of employment in their respec\ufffdve loca\ufffdons, with jobs in the plants plus mining and related jobs associated with fuelling these plants with local coal. To minimise the impact on these communi\ufffdes, the government has mandated that the transi\ufffdon be conducted within the framework of a \"Just Transi\ufffdon\" where jobs are maintained as much as possible and where-ever possible new jobs created in those loca\ufffdons. This must be a part of the planning for any renewable based system. One of the major ques\ufffdons that is always present in any forecast for power genera\ufffdon requirements is the forecas\ufffdng of the demand profile. In 1990, a study on electricity forecas\ufffdng in the USA stated (Hobbs \n& Maheshwari, 1990): \n\"Planning decisions are severely affected by uncertainties in demand. This fact has two implications: accurate forecasts of demand are worth more than forecasts of other parameters, and the expected cost of ignoring demand uncertainties exceeds the cost of disregarding other sources of risk.\"  \nIn the past, it was believed that the demand for electricity would grow at a rate roughly equal to the growth in GDP in the area being served (Sharma, Smeets & Tryggestad, 2019). However, over the last 15 \nyears, the power genera\ufffdon from the central power provider in South Africa has been decreasing steadily. On average, demand has been decreasing by 0.5% per year, and this rate of decrease appears to be increasing, as illustrated in Figure 4 (Pierce & le Roux, 2023). This trend is likely due to several factors, including the adop\ufffdon of energy-efficient technologies such as LED ligh\ufffdng, the conversion of heavy energy users to less intense energy opera\ufffdons, and the rise in self-genera\ufffdon (such as behind-the-meter solar installa\ufffdons). While some argue that the rapid electrifica\ufffdon of major power uses, such as the growth of the electric vehicle market, will reverse this trend and lead to large increases in power demand, there is a significant uncertainty about the future demand (Merven, 2023). Therefore, any plan to address future electricity demand must be flexible enough to adapt to uncertainty and changes in demand growth. Building baseload genera\ufffdon plants to meet unknown demand is challenging because of the \ufffdme required to construct these plants and the economies of scale associated the size of the plants. This can result in either a capacity under build, which leads to unserved demand, or an over build, which results in higher costs.  \n \n"

        "title": "In June 2023, the South African Presiden\ufffdal Climate Commission (PCC) released its recommenda\ufffdons on South Africa's electricity system. The report suggested that a least-cost approach to genera\ufffdng electricity would require a significant increase in the construc\ufffdon of renewable energy sources supported by batery storage and *gas peakers* (Creamer, 2023). This transi\ufffdon to renewable energy sources is also being embraced globally, and many countries are rapidly increasing their wind and solar genera\ufffdon capacity. Numerous studies conducted by the CSIR, and other ins\ufffdtu\ufffdons, have corroborated the findings of the PCC report, which advocates for a least-cost system based on renewable energy sources (Bischof-Niemz, ",
        "content": "2017; Roy, Sinha & Shah, 2020). However, there is a subtle yet significant difference in conclusion: the requirement is for *firm-dispatchable* power instead of *peaking* power (Clark & McGregor, 2024).  \nThese studies have shown that even with the lowest cost genera\ufffdon system, it is s\ufffdll essen\ufffdal to have installed firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon capacity to meet the system's needs during \ufffdmes when wind and solar power are unable to meet demand. This period of low renewable resources could happen for several days each year, and in some years, it could be for periods of several weeks (Clark, Van Niekerk & Petrie, \n2020). This requirement was tested in models of the South Africa grid and models of the Texas and UK \ngrids, which all showed similar results (Clark & McGregor, 2024). It is not a replacement for base load genera\ufffdon but would be u\ufffdlised less than 10% of the \ufffdme and must always be available. Opera\ufffdng baseload plants with this low u\ufffdlisa\ufffdon rate would be expensive due to the high capital cost of thermal plants (Bergh & Delarue, 2015). Interna\ufffdonal experience has shown that using the baseload plants in cycling mode reduces their expected lifespan by adding fa\ufffdgue stress to elements of the plant that are not designed for this mode of opera\ufffdon (Kumar et al., 2012; Nichols, 2016). \n"

        "content": "\nAs men\ufffdoned earlier and illustrated in past analyses, it is necessary to have firm-dispatchable power genera\ufffdon available to fully support the por\ufffdon of the total power genera\ufffdon that is being supplied by variable sources such as wind and solar. In other words, this firm-dispatchable power genera\ufffdon must be installed to completely subs\ufffdtute the volume of base load power that is being decommissioned, and it must be done at the same pace as the decommissioning process (Clark & McGregor, 2024). There is also a need to provide firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon to complement the variable sources of genera\ufffdon (wind and solar) that have already been installed on the grid. \n\nThe current demand from the Eskom grid is 222 TWh per year, with a peak demand of 35 GW and an average of 25 GW over the year. Table 1 shows the sources of genera\ufffdon in the current system (Pierce & \nle Roux, 2023). As men\ufffdoned earlier, coal is the primary genera\ufffdon source, but the capacity factor of the coal fleet is low. \n\n|                |   Technology  |   Installed Cap - GW Genera\ufffdon - TWh  |   Percent of total  |   Capacity Factor - %  |\n|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Coal           |          39.8 |                                 176.6 |                80.1 |                   50.7 |\n| Nuclear        |           1.9 |                                  10.1 |                 4.6 |                   60.7 |\n| Hydro + pumped |           3.3 |                                  14   |                 6.4 |                   48.4 |\n| Wind           |           3.4 |                                   9.7 |                 4.3 |                   32.6 |\n| Solar (PV+CSP) |           2.8 |                                   6.5 |                 2.8 |                   26.5 |\n| Dispatchable   |           3.4 |                                   3.6 |                 1.6 |                   12.1 |\n|                |               |                                       |                     |                        |\n\nFi\ufffdeen coal-fired power plants are currently installed with a total rated electricity capacity of 39.8 GW. \n\nThe power plants have different capaci\ufffdes, ranging from 990 MW to 4.8 GW, with an average size of 2.6 GW (Eskom, n.d.) The fleet's overall age is 36 years from the commissioning date. However, two recently built plants contribute nearly a quarter of the installed capacity, 9.6 GW out of the total 39.8 GW capacity \n(Eskom, n.d.). Without the two new plants, the rest of the fleet has an age range from 22 to 57 years and an average age of 41. Eskom has planned a decommissioning schedule as indicated above in Figure 1.  \nThe output for the nuclear plant located at Koeberg has dropped from approximately 85% in 2016 to the current EAF in the range of 65%, according to repor\ufffdng from Eskom. This EAF decrease for Koeberg is shown in Figure 5 (Eskom, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023). This plant has recently undergone a major refurbishment and will remain opera\ufffdonal un\ufffdl 2044. It is expected that this plant will have reached its economic life at that \ufffdme and will be decommissioned near the end of the planning period. Hydropower facili\ufffdes generally have a longer life expectancy than thermal power plants (US Dept. of Energy, 2003). The 0.6 GW of hydro genera\ufffdon and 2.7 GW of pumped storage should be available throughout the current planning term un\ufffdl 2050. Assuming the 35 GW of current baseload genera\ufffdon needs to be replaced with equivalent plants, this would mean construc\ufffdng 25 GW of coal plants or nuclear (with an assumed 70% EAF) over the next twenty-five years. That is, on average, a capacity of 1000 MW is added annually. This assumes that the demand profile remains the same but with enough genera\ufffdon installed to eliminate load shedding. According to the US EIA capital cost es\ufffdmates, shown in Figure 6, and detailed in Table 2, this would require an investment of USD 171 billion for these new coal power plants (US EIA, 2023). For nuclear, the capital cost would be slightly more, at $185 billion USD. However, the expected \ufffdming to build new baseload plants and the experience from the last two plants built in South Africa suggest a construc\ufffdon \ufffdme of over 14 years, which means that this program is years behind what would be required (World Bank, 2023). This is a completely unrealis\ufffdc scenario.  \n\n| Cost                                     | per     | Cost    |   per  |      |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|------|\n| Technology                               |         |         |        |      |\n| Unit Cost                                |         |         |        |      |\n| USD/kW                                   |         |         |        |      |\n| New Capacity                             |         |         |        |      |\n| GW                                       |         |         |        |      |\n| Total Cost                               |         |         |        |      |\n| Billion USD                              |         |         |        |      |\n| Annual Cost                              |         |         |        |      |\n| Billion USD                              | kWh ZAR |         |        |      |\n| (19 ZAR/USD)                             |         |         |        |      |\n|                                          |         |         |        |      |\n| MWh                                      |         |         |        |      |\n| USD / MWh                                |         |         |        |      |\n| Base Load System                         |         |         |        |      |\n| Coal                                     | 6876    | 25      |  171   |  6.8 |\n| Nuclear                                  | 7406    | 25      |  185   |  7.4 |\n| Renewable Based System                   |         |         |        |      |\n| Wind                                     | 2098    | 49      |  102   |  4.1 |\n| Solar PV                                 | 1448    | 14      |   20   |  0.8 |\n| BESS                                     | 400 (1) | 24 (2)  |   10   |  0.4 |\n| OGCT                                     | 867     | 15      |   13   |  0.5 |\n|                                          |         | 145     |    5.8 | 26   |\n| Renewable                                |         |         |        |      |\n|                                          |         |         |        |      |\n| (1)                                      |         |         |        |      |\n|                                          |         |         |        |      |\n| BESS costs are in USD per kWh of storage |         |         |        |      |\n| (2)                                      |         |         |        |      |\n|                                          |         |         |        |      |\n| BESS capacity is in GWh of storage       |         |         |        |      |\n"

        "title": "The previous \"business as usual\" scenarios can be compared with a renewable-based genera\ufffdon system that mostly relies on wind and solar power. At the end of the 25-year planning period, this renewable system is expected to retain 12.9 GW of baseload, while wind and solar will replace all the decommissioned genera\ufffdon. The remaining baseload genera\ufffdon will come from the newly built coalfuelled plants (Medupi and Kusile) and hydropower, which only need to be replaced beyond the end of the planning period. Based on the current demand profile, the model indicates that 49 GW of new wind and 14 GW of new u\ufffdlity solar will be required, plus 24 GWh of new Batery storage, with 15 GW of new firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon required with an expected u\ufffdlisa\ufffdon of 5%. The total capital cost for this system over the next twenty-five years would be 145 billion USD based on the US EIA 2023 cost es\ufffdmates ",
        "content": "(US EIA, 2023). The costs for this alternate renewable based system are detailed in Table 2. \n\nOne of the major advantages of the new wind and solar-based system is that it saves on fuel costs. \n\nCurrently, the 176 TWh of genera\ufffdon from the coal fleet costs approximately 2.2 billion USD per year in fuel expenses, assuming coal costs approximately 100 USD per ton (GlobalEconomy.com, 2024). Once the coal-fuelled plants are decommissioned, some fuel will s\ufffdll be required to run the firm-dispatchable power. Assuming a 20 USD per GJ fuel, the cost of fuel for the 9 TWh of genera\ufffdon expected from these plants (compared to the current system's 3.6 TWh) would have an addi\ufffdonal cost of 750 million USD. Therefore, elimina\ufffdng the older coal genera\ufffdon plants would result in a fuel savings of approximately 75%, or over 1.7 billion USD annually. The fuel cost for the firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon should be kept to a minimum, only using what is needed to keep the system balanced. Based on these calcula\ufffdons, it has been determined that a renewable-based genera\ufffdon system would require over 30 billion USD less in capital cost than the tradi\ufffdonal business-as-usual system in addi\ufffdon to the expected annual fuel savings of 1.7 billion USD. Therefore, the cost of power genera\ufffdon from the renewable system in the next 20 years would be 25% less expensive than that of a coal-based system. The renewable system would also produce significantly less pollu\ufffdon and minimal greenhouse gas emissions.  \nThe system's reduced development schedule and modular investments also make it more responsive to changes in demand forecasts. As can be seen from the range of sizes for the coal plants in South Africa of 900 MW to 4800 MW with the two new plants at the top of this size, coal plants are generally built on large sizes to take advantage of economies of scale. This is considering loca\ufffdons near fuel sources as well as efficiency of the plant (Jan Van Helden & Muysken, 1981). These plants also take many years to construct. The two new coal plants in South Africa took 14 years from approval to commissioning. The World Bank indicates that coal plants take 10 to 12 years from financial close to comple\ufffdon, while renewable energy projects have a construc\ufffdon \ufffdme of less than 2 years (World Bank, 2023). The peaking plants in South Africa are in sizes from 120 MW up to 1300 MW consis\ufffdng of combus\ufffdon engine plants and open cycle gas turbines (OCGT). These technologies can be built modularly as needed, and their construc\ufffdon \ufffdmes is less than three years. The 140 MW combus\ufffdon engine power plant at Sasolburg was constructed in 15 month (Sasol, 2013) . Eskom constructed both the 1327 MW Ankerlig and 740 MW \nGourikwa OCGT plants within two years (Eskom, 2014). Combus\ufffdon engine and fuel cell plants are usually built with units of up to 10 MW, while OCGT plants can be built with units of up to several hundred MW. \n\nTurbine generators require some de-ra\ufffdng when installed at al\ufffdtude and high ambient temperatures as in the High Veldt. Combus\ufffdon engine plants might be preferred at these condi\ufffdons (Clark, 2016). Genera\ufffdon plants can be made with mul\ufffd-units, with expected plant sizes ranging from 100 to 1500 MW. While coal plants are generally \ufffded to their fuel source, there is not a direct need for peaking plants to be \ufffded to a fuel source. With low capital cost, modular sizing, short construc\ufffdon \ufffdme and not being \ufffded to a specific loca\ufffdon, these firm-dispatchable plants add to a flexible program. \n"

        "content": "\nAs noted in the introduc\ufffdon, demand forecasts are one of the most significant factors in having an op\ufffdmal development program. However, this is one of the most difficult parameters to es\ufffdmate. Figure 7 shows the history of the demand curve in South Africa for the last fi\ufffdeen years and current growth forecast. This fi\ufffdeen years is the period where the country has been working on implemen\ufffdng the IRP program. \n\nAccording to the forecast from the 2010 IRP, the demand for 2022 should have been 385 TWh per year, nearly twice the actual 2022 genera\ufffdon of 220 TWh (Department of Energy, 2011; Pierce & le Roux, 2023). \n\nThe 2010 forecast demand would have required that over 30 GW of new genera\ufffdon should have been added to the system by now. With Eskom unable to meet the actual demand, it is quite fortunate that the 2010 forecast was not what happened.  \nThe actual trend has been consistently downward at 0.5% per year on average. The demand over the last fi\ufffdeen years has decreased by over 10%. Even with this decrease, Eskom has not been able to supply the demand and load shedding has increased significantly. These numbers lay out the financial consequences of demand changes not being as forecast. If the forecast had been followed an addi\ufffdonal 30 GW of baseload genera\ufffdon should have been installed by now, with all its addi\ufffdonal costs. However, no addi\ufffdonal base load except for the two new coal plants that had been in the plan prior to commencement of the IRP.  Only a minimal amount of renewable genera\ufffdon was constructed, 3.4 GW of wind and 2.8 GW \nof solar, since the IRP program started, with no associated firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon. This has not offset the loss of over 8 GW of base load genera\ufffdon due to performance degrada\ufffdon from the installed fleet. \n\nThe cost of this underbuilding has been increased load shedding, with the associated indirect costs. \n\nWhile no plan can withstand a \"no ac\ufffdon\" plan, a development based on wind, solar, bateries and firmdispatchable genera\ufffdon offers the best chance to recover from past inac\ufffdon and to meet whatever the actual demand will be. The forecast for demand should be a range that commences from the current downward trend, to what is in the current IRP. The ac\ufffdon plan should be developing a program that can meet any demand within this range. With the short two-year development \ufffdmes for wind, solar, bateries and firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon, plus their modularity, this flexibility is reasonable. \n\n"

        "content": "\nIt is an\ufffdcipated that the demand for electricity genera\ufffdon will change through the 25-year planning cycle, and the economics of opera\ufffdng coal plants may affect the decommissioning program. However, it is essen\ufffdal to plan the development of firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon, with a target of construc\ufffdng 15 GW of new capacity over the next 25 years, or approximately 0.75 GW per year. This will cost around 650 million USD annually, less than 10% of the total investment program. Immediate implementa\ufffdon of this program is necessary to meet the current impact of load shedding which is an\ufffdcipated to last through 2027 \naccording to the latest IRP (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2024). This addi\ufffdon of genera\ufffdon should be done to keep the total Eskom firm capacity at a minimum of 35 GW assuming that the demand remains at the current level.  \nIn a report in 2018, the CSIR calculated that the immediate need for addi\ufffdonal firm-dispatchable power was over 5 GW at that \ufffdme (Wright, Calitz & Kamera, 2018). As the base load genera\ufffdon fleet performance has con\ufffdnued to deteriorate since that analysis, the current shor\ufffdall for firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon is over 10 GW. A\ufffder the current shor\ufffdall is overcome, the implementa\ufffdon schedule can be adjusted as changes arise in the demand profile, decommissioning program, and wind and solar energy implementa\ufffdon.  \nFirm-dispatchable power genera\ufffdon requires specific technology performance parameters, which include fast ramp rates. This can be achieved with internal combus\ufffdon engine (ICE) plants, gas turbines (OCGT or CCGT), and fuel cells. Currently, both combus\ufffdon engine and OCGT plants are used in the country. Fuel cells are more expensive, but they have higher efficiency. With further development, the technology is expected to eventually become economically compe\ufffd\ufffdve. These technologies can use various fuels, including natural gas, LPG, diesel, biofuel, and clean hydrogen. The choice of fuel is generally based on the delivered cost, which must include the logis\ufffdcs cost of delivery to the plant and the seasonal storage costs to keep fuel volumes sufficient to run the plant for several days. With the range of poten\ufffdal fuels and the ability to deliver them to most loca\ufffdons, the si\ufffdng for firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon is not \ufffded to its fuel source as much as coal-fuelled plants, typically built at coal mine loca\ufffdons to minimise fuel transport. Due to its convenience in usage from easy delivery and storage, Eskom has tradi\ufffdonally used diesel for its peaking plants. However, diesel is an expensive choice and the budget for this fuel has become a major issue for Eskom. Going forward, Eskom is likely to switch to alternate fuels where-ever possible to reduce costs. The choices could be natural gas, LPG or biofuels.  \nIn South Africa, natural gas is not an ideal choice for dispatchable power due to the lack of local produc\ufffdon and limited distribu\ufffdon infrastructure, unlike in Europe or North America (Clark et al., 2022). Currently, natural gas is available through the Rompco pipeline in eastern part of South Africa. However, the gas fields supplying the Rompco pipeline are approaching the end of their life, making it difficult to plan around this supply (Creamer, 2019). Natural gas importa\ufffdon facili\ufffdes in the form of LNG terminals or pipeline gas are quite capital-intensive. Natural gas would only become a reasonable alterna\ufffdve if other gas markets developed to support its importa\ufffdon, which is considered unlikely by several studies (Clark et al., 2022). \n\nStorage of natural gas at the loca\ufffdon of the genera\ufffdon plant is also a challenge that must be addressed. LPG has been recommended as an alterna\ufffdve fuel for Ankerlig and might be a reasonable choice for most plant loca\ufffdons (Clark, McGregor & Van Niekerk, 2022). As this fuel historically has been about 60% of the price of diesel fuel on the interna\ufffdonal market, it could be an economically atrac\ufffdve choice. This fuel does have the convenience of being a liquid fuel like diesel at nominal pressure and temperature, with related convenience of delivery and storage. This is a fuel that could be immediately used and will likely be less expensive to import and use than LNG will be.  \nThe choice of fuel can change over \ufffdme. As the use of these plants is intended to be minimised, greenhouse gas emissions from these plants are a lower priority for most systems. Over \ufffdme, these plants must shi\ufffd to zero-emission fuels such as hydrogen, ammonia, or biofuel.  \n"

        "content": "\nFirm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon can be installed in loca\ufffdons that maximise its value within the system. This generally implies si\ufffdng these plants close to major load centres and in places where the grid can handle the input without major changes. \n\nThe loca\ufffdon of firm-dispatchable power genera\ufffdon should be chosen based on where it can provide the most value to the power grid at the lowest cost. This can be based on economic or social factors, among other considera\ufffdons. The \"Just Transi\ufffdon\" concept is a part of government policy that aims to minimize disrup\ufffdons to current employment paterns during the energy transi\ufffdon (Govt of South Africa, 2023). Therefore, it is important to consider this concept when selec\ufffdng the loca\ufffdon for firm-dispatchable power genera\ufffdon. \n\nOne possible solu\ufffdon for placing firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon plants that meet social and economic parameters for maximum value is to construct them at the sites of decommissioned coal-fired power plants. This can be achieved by removing the base load genera\ufffdon plant while retaining the substa\ufffdon and grid connec\ufffdon. The new firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon plant can then be built at the former base load plant loca\ufffdon, in a size that is deemed suitable. From a grid integra\ufffdon perspec\ufffdve these sites are expected to have a mostly posi\ufffdve impact on the grid and minimal nega\ufffdve consequences. The infrastructure already in place at these loca\ufffdons makes it easy to integrate power into the grid, allowing for firm genera\ufffdon replacement up to the capacity of the decommissioned coal plant. As a result, there should be no doubt about the grid's ability to handle this power input, given the exis\ufffdng grid connec\ufffdon. From an economic perspec\ufffdve, these loca\ufffdons offer two advantages: minimized grid connec\ufffdon costs due to the use of exis\ufffdng connec\ufffdons, and construc\ufffdon on an exis\ufffdng site. One of the major costs and \ufffdme factors in building any power plant is in the permi\ufffdng process. Environmental and social parameters must be studied in detail for any new construc\ufffdon. Building on the site of an exis\ufffdng opera\ufffdon will minimize this cost and \ufffdme. Elimina\ufffdng the coal plant will have a posi\ufffdve impact on the environment by reducing pollu\ufffdon and improving the health of the community. However, the use of any new fossil fuel in the genera\ufffdon of dispatchable power may s\ufffdll result in some greenhouse gas and pollu\ufffdon emissions. These emissions will be far less than those produced by the original coal-fuelled power sta\ufffdon. With eventual conversion of the fuel to green hydrogen, derived from excess renewable genera\ufffdon, these emissions can be eliminated. To maximize the value of the firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon and eliminate the emissions from the plant, it should be feasible to co-locate a hydrogen produc\ufffdon and storage on the site of the former base load plant. This should maximize the value of the plant for the net-zero grid. \n\nFrom the perspec\ufffdve of the Just Transi\ufffdon, repurposing former baseload power plant sites to firmdispatchable power can help minimize the impact on local employment. The skill sets required to operate the new plant are similar to those used in the opera\ufffdon of the coal power sta\ufffdon, requiring only minimal retraining. Employment related to the supply of coal to the plant will be eliminated with the decommissioning of the exis\ufffdng plant in any scenario. However, there will be some employment opportuni\ufffdes created with the fuel supply for the new plant. While decommissioning any major baseload plant will cause significant employment disrup\ufffdons, using the site for some of the required firmdispatchable genera\ufffdon can help reduce this impact. \n"

Many u\ufffdlity operators are considering the repurposing of baseload plants as firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon to facilitate the energy transi\ufffdon (World Bank Group, 2021; Henkel, 2023). One recent example is the rebuilding of a 95-year-old power plant in the US state of Florida, renamed the \"Dania Beach Clean Energy Center\". Florida Power and Light, the plant's operator, plans to rebuild it as a firm-dispatchable plant with two OCGTs with each genera\ufffdng 580 MW. The operator has stated that this repurposed plant will become a major factor in support of the rapid deployment of solar genera\ufffdon in their system (Florida Power and Light, n.d.). They have also indicated that the plant can be converted to hydrogen fuel when it becomes economically viable. The Florida plant will be upgraded by completely replacing the old plant with a new one at the same loca\ufffdon. A photograph of the original plant built in 1927 is shown in Figure 8. The new firm-dispatchable energy plant will replace a base load gas plant that was built at the same loca\ufffdon in the 1990s. Computer renderings from the operator of the exis\ufffdng gas plant and the new plant can be seen in Figures 9 and 10 \n(Florida Power and Light, n.d.). This approach can also be implemented at the baseload coal power sta\ufffdons in the Eskom system. \n\n  \n \n"

It is clear from the Eskom coal plant decommissioning program that three of the plants are currently due, or overdue, for decommissioning.

While the loca\ufffdons of the exis\ufffdng plants will provide loca\ufffdon for some of the required firm-dispatchable genera\ufffdon, there will be other loca\ufffdons near load centres that also offer advantages that must be considered.  \n \n\n3.

Engineering analysis of conversion to zero-emission fuels \nEventually, these plants must be part of a net zero genera\ufffdon system and as such, there must be an engineering program to make the conversions of these plants to zero emission fuels. This could take the form of hydrogen generated from the excess renewable genera\ufffdon or poten\ufffdally from biofuels.
