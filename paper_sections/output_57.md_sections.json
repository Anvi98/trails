        "title": "Summary",
        "content": "\nObjective: Most current wearable tonic-clonic seizure (TCS) detection systems are based on extracerebral signals, such as electromyography (EMG) or accelerometry (ACC). Although many of these devices show good sensitivity in seizure detection, their false positive rates (FPR) are still relatively high. Wearable EEG may improve performance; however, studies investigating this remain scarce. This paper aims 1) to investigate the possibility of detecting TCSs with a behind-the-ear, two-channel wearable EEG, and 2) to evaluate the added value of wearable EEG to other non-EEG modalities in multimodal TCS \ndetection. \n\nMethod: We included 27 participants with a total of 44 TCSs from the European multicenter study SeizeIT2. The multimodal wearable detection system Sensor Dot (Byteflies) was used to measure twochannel, behind-the-ear EEG, EMG, electrocardiography (ECG), ACC and gyroscope (GYR). First, we evaluated automatic unimodal detection of TCSs, using performance metrics such as sensitivity, precision, FPR and F1-score. Secondly, we fused the different modalities and again assessed performance. Algorithm-labeled segments were then provided to a neurologist and a wearable data expert, who reviewed and annotated the true positive TCSs, and discarded false positives (FPs). \n\nResults: Wearable EEG outperformed the other modalities in unimodal TCS detection by achieving a sensitivity of 100.0% and a FPR of 10.3/24h (compared to 97.7% sensitivity and 30.9/24h FPR for EMG; 95.5% sensitivity and 13.9 FPR for ACC). The combination of wearable EEG and EMG achieved overall the most clinically useful performance in offline TCS detection with a sensitivity of 97.7%, a FPR of 0.4/24 h, a precision of 43.0%, and a F1-score of 59.7%. Subsequent visual review of the automated detections resulted in maximal sensitivity and zero FPs. \n\nSignificance: In TCS detection with a wearable device, the main advantage of combining EEG with ACC, EMG or both was a marked reduction in FPR, while retaining a high sensitivity.  \nKeywords: Epilepsy, tonic-clonic seizures, wearable EEG, multimodal seizure detection \n"

        "title": "1 Introduction",
        "content": "\nTonic-clonic seizures (TCS) are the most severe seizure type and can be of either focal or generalized onset. TCSs consist of two phases: during the tonic phase, there is stiffening of the muscles in the body, while in the clonic phase, jerking movements of the limbs are present. After the seizure has ended, the postictal period is characterized by a slow recovery from a comatose state, typically over 15-30 minutes. TCSs are the most important risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) (1). It has been estimated that 69% of SUDEP cases in people who have TCS and live alone could be prevented if those individuals were attended at night or were free from TCS (2). Therefore, long-term home monitoring could be useful to improve detection and alert a caregiver to check on the patient whenever they have a TCS, consequently reducing morbidity and mortality (3, 4). \n\nAlthough video-EEG is the gold standard for seizure detection, it is not suitable for long-term monitoring at home. To enable such long-term monitoring, a large variety of wearable TCS detection systems have been proposed (5, 6). Most wearable TCS detection systems are based on measurement of extra-cerebral signals, e.g., electromyography (EMG), accelerometer (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA) and, electrocardiography (ECG).  \nEMG-based approaches have achieved high sensitivity, however, false positives (FPs) caused by muscle artifacts are relatively high, affecting their application in long-term monitoring (7-10). ACC, which reflects the changes in movement frequency and amplitude caused by TCSs, has also been widely used in TCS detection (11-14). The advantage of an ACC device is that it is small and requires no electrodes, making it more comfortable (13). In contrast, it is even more challenging for ACC-based approaches to avoid FPs, since certain daily activities often mimic the movement frequency and amplitude of seizures to produce seizure-like patterns e.g. while brushing teeth and playing cards (12). TCSs are also characterized by an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity, resulting in sweating and ictal tachycardia. EDA measures the electrical conductance of the skin, or sweating, and therefore, could be used for TCS detection (15, 16). However, EDA is limited by variable accuracy. Furthermore, ECG-based algorithms which could detect ictal tachycardia, have to be patient-specific due to the large variance in individual heart rate (17, 18). \n\nA recent systematic review showed that ACC- and EMG-based systems have a high sensitivity but relatively high FPR, and suggested that future research focus on reducing FPR (19). To this end, EEG might perform better in TCS detection as it can directly monitor brain activity rather than indirect extracerebral biosignals. However, wearable EEG-based seizure detection remains challenging as it has to be unobtrusive, easy-to-wear, and not stigmatizing (20, 21). Moreover, such technology also suffers from muscle and movement artifacts when deployed in daily life.  \nRecently, our research showed the possibility of detecting seizures with only two discreet behind-the-ear (BTE)-EEG channels (22-25). The Sensor Dot (SD; Byteflies) is an unobtrusive multimodal wearable system measuring BTE-EEG, EMG, ECG, and movement through ACC and gyroscope (GYR) sensors \n(26).  \nThis paper first investigates unimodal BTE-EEG in offline TCS detection and compares it with results of EMG, ACC and ECG. Secondly, we establish a simple multimodal TCS detection framework by combining the most relevant modalities. Finally, we use this multimodal detection algorithm to review the SD recordings and perform visual review of the automated detections to retain true positives (TPs) and discard FPs, so that TCS can be reliably logged and counted. In the future, we also aim to develop a real time detection system based on this research, which will require further development. \n"

Namely, a detection will be triggered when a certain number of positive detections (36 positive detections for the combination of two modalities, 54 positive detections for the combination of three modalities) have been given in the 20 consecutive windows to tolerate artifacts.

        "content": "\nSeveral wearables to detect TCS based on EMG- or ACC measurement are currently available. The sensitivity of these devices is high, but FPR is also relatively high (19). Our main finding is that multimodal measurement of EEG, EMG and ACC can reduce FPR considerably. We have shown that each of these three modalities is sensitive in detecting TCS. By combining EEG with EMG or ACC, the sensitivity remained high, since TCS involve very typical patterns in these three signals. Automated detections in EEG, EMG or ACC, which were not confirmed in the other two signals, tended to be FP and were discarded. Previous theoretical research has shown that combining different modalities can outperform the unimodal counterparts in specific situations (34), which we confirm here. The multimodal detector using EEG, EMG and ACC had the highest F1-score (82.5% [0%: low sensitivity and PPV; 100%: \noptimal sensitivity and PPV]) followed by EEG and EMG (59.7%). \n\nOur study focused on offline multimodal wearable detection of TCSs. In contrast to currently available wearables to detect TCS, our methodology allowed a visual review of recorded data. Visual review of automated detections enabled us to discard all FPs while maintaining maximal sensitivity. For visual review by experts, we used the EMG and EEG detector, since it had the highest sensitivity among the two detectors with the highest F1-score. Additionally, time needed to visually review the algorithm labels was 3.55 minutes for a 24-hour recording. This method could be used to log TCS in a reliable way, which could be used in clinical practice or anti-seizure medication trials.  \nPreviously, Szabo and colleagues reported the best results using a unimodal EMG-based TCS detector (95.5% sensitivity, 0.02 FPR/24 hours) (35) and Kusmakar and colleagues with a unimodal ACC-based detector (95.2% sensitivity, 0.72 FPR/24 hours) (13). Our unimodal sensitivities for BTE-EEG, EMG, and ACC were comparable. The FPR of our unimodal EMG (31.9/24 hours), ACC (13.9/24 hours), and even EEG-based detectors (10.3/24 hours) were, though, strikingly higher. Even by reproducing the algorithm proposed in (36) on our dataset, the FPR remained high. This indicated poorer signal quality of our dataset (Figure 3). We observed that the baseline in the SD measurement is unstable and can make sudden jumps, which frequently coincided with FP detections. It would be of interest to study how much further FPR could be reduced when the signal quality of the multimodal detectors is optimized. It is also worth noting that the FNs were usually due to poor signal quality. For example, the EEG signals of patient 24 were partly corrupted into flat lines due to technical problems. The performance can be further improved if these technical problems were solved in the future. \n\nThe F1-score of the multimodal detector combining EMG of the deltoid muscle and ACC had a rather low F1-score of 41.5% and underperformed the multimodal combination including EEG. This could be because their FPs usually occur together as both modalities are related to body movement and signal quality is possibly poorer. \n\nVisual analysis of our data, as in Figure 2, showed that EEG detection of TCS occurred during the tonic and clonic phase. In these phases, the EEG cerebral signal is largely obscured by prominent muscle artifacts. It is our interpretation that the unimodal EEG algorithm was mainly triggered by the scalp muscle EMG artifacts during the tonic and clonic phase. It highlights that the typical movement, which is captured from the scalp (through muscle activity and possible artifacts), is crucial for the accuracy of the TCS detector, and that scalp electrodes are better than deltoid electrodes for picking up such activity. Moreover, the actual cerebral activity on the EEG channels was used in the algorithm development to filter background activity and during visual review by experts as an additional characteristic of an FBTC to support their opinion. \n"

        "content": "\nThough our work shows the benefit of a multimodal detection framework consisting of EEG and EMG/ACC in TCS detection, there are important limitations. \n\nFirst, this research was a phase 2 validation and thus consisted of collection of data within the hospital environment. In the future, we will further evaluate the proposed method outside of the hospital environment, which will be affected by more artifacts, potentially lowering the performance of the device \n(37). \n\nSecondly, the detection algorithm could be further improved into a sequence-to-sequence model that could learn/recognize the typical evolution of TCSs with continuous muscle contraction during the tonic phase followed by a sequence of muscle contractions and relaxations with gradually decreasing frequency during the clonic phase.  \nThirdly, the visual review time by experts of the SD recordings **was around 2 min**. To achieve a similar, short review time, training is needed to recognize the typical patterns in the different modalities. \n\nFinally, the population was reduced due to the loss of at least one modality in 21 participants. Our future work will focus on developing a multimodal co-learning algorithm that is robust for missing modalities inputs. With a co-learning algorithm, the multimodal information in the training process could help improve the performance of the unimodal task at test time (38). Furthermore, some of the modalities were lost because of depletion of the battery of the SD. This could be avoided by either a notification from the device to the patient or by improving battery capacity. Finally, electrodes were sometimes disconnected due to movement during TCS. Further development of improved adhesive electrodes is therefore necessary.  \nFuture research will focus on online detection of TCSs. Previous work has investigated patients' requirements for an online seizure detection system. People with epilepsy desire a FPR between 1 to 2 per month if they have a low seizure frequency and a FPR between 1 to 2 per week if they have a higher seizure frequency (39). The combinations of BTE-EEG and EMG satisfies the desire of only having 1 to 2 FPs per week while keeping a high sensitivity. Our eventual aim is to develop a real-time detection system for TCS in order to alert caregivers. The high computational efficiency of the EEG and EMG methods indicates that the algorithm could run in real-time with the addition of a powerful processor or a real-time streaming to the cloud (40). For online detection, one could consider the combination of ACC, EMG and EEG, which had the best F1-score in our study, combining a high sensitivity with high PPV/precision. Unfortunately, the currently available SD EEG and EMG adhesive patches hamper the possibility of long-term monitoring over months due to limited signal quality and skin irritation. Besides providing long-term objective documentation of TCS frequency, wearables can also be used to assess disease severity (41, 42). TCS is a main risk factor for SUDEP, and an accurate TCS detector with online alarm function, can alert family members and caregivers. Various biomarkers known to be associated with a higher risk of SUDEP can be derived from the multimodal SD wearable detection device. Going forwards, it should be possible, for example, to study postictal generalized suppression (PGES) on the BTE-EEG, postictal tachycardia on the ECG, and respiration. If these data could be collected over longer periods of time in large cohorts, new insights into the pathophysiology of SUDEP could be obtained, and individual risk profiles could be developed based on these biomarkers (43-46).  \nIn conclusion, we showed that unimodal detection with wearable EEG (BTE-EEG) outperformed the other modalities in TCS detection. Our results confirm that multimodal approaches, in particular those combinations with BTE-EEG, are able to improve the TCS detection performance over unimodal approaches by reducing FPR. This suggests that wearable BTE-EEG has the potential to play an important role in TCS detection in future research. \n"
