        "content": "\nRhea Acharya1\nrlacharya@college.harvard.edu Jessica Chen1\njessica chen@college.harvard.edu Helen Xiao1\nAbstract\u2014Peer-to-peer ride-sharing platforms like Uber, Lyft, and DiDi have revolutionized the transportation industry and labor market. At its essence, these systems tackle the bipartite matching problem between two populations: riders and drivers. This research paper comprises two main components: an initial literature review of existing ride-sharing platforms and efforts to enhance driver satisfaction, and the development of a novel algorithm implemented through simulation testing to allow us to make our own observations. The core algorithm utilized is the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm, applied to a static matching problem over multiple time periods. In this simulation, we construct a preference-aware task assignment model, considering both overall revenue maximization and individual preference satisfaction. Specifically, the algorithm design incorporates factors such as passenger willingness-to-pay, driver preferences, and location attractiveness, with an overarching goal of achieving equitable income distribution for drivers while maintaining overall system efficiency.\n\nThrough simulation, the paper compares the performance of the proposed algorithm with random matching and closest neighbor algorithms, looking at metrics such as total revenue, revenue per ride, and standard deviation to identify trends and impacts of shifting priorities. Additionally, the DA algorithm is compared to the Boston algorithm, and the paper explores the effect of prioritizing proximity to passengers versus distance from city center. Ultimately, the research underscores the importance of continued exploration in areas such as dynamic pricing models and additional modeling for unconventional driving times to further enhance the findings on the effectiveness and fairness of ride-sharing platforms.\n\nOur simulation code can be found here.\n"

        "content": "\nThe subway breaks down on our way to work, it's 2:30 a.m.\n\nand we need to get home after a night of clubbing, we're in a new city and need to get from the airport to a museum across town - what's our first instinct? \"Call an Uber.\" In this digital age, we rely on ride-sharing apps as an integral part of daily life. Passengers turn to driving apps, trusting that they will be able to get from their current destination to the next in a fast and safe way, without breaking their wallets. Ride-sharing apps like Uber, Lyft, and Didi, eager to gain more revenue, prioritize meeting these needs to provide a positive experience to passengers, hoping they will use the apps more and spend more money.\n\nThis means that apps have historically maximized rider satisfaction, ensuring that riders are likely to continue to use their services, as without them, the apps would not be able to survive. However, research has shown that in matching problems like this one, when the needs of one party is helenxiao@college.harvard.edu prioritized, those of the other can be sometimes hurt. Here, by prioritizing riders, the matching mechanisms might be creating pessimal outcomes for the drivers. If the negative effects are too large, this could have significant consequences on driver satisfaction and equity.\n\nPotential concerns related to this have already been seen by the public eye. In recent years, these ridesharing apps have come under fire for the driver experience that they provided. For example, a CNBC article found that only 4% of Uber drivers are still driving a year later. Additionally, Uber and Lyft have bought been sued for withholding money from drivers, and drivers are frequently commenting on the unsustainability of the role in outlets like The New York Times. Why is this the case? Is it inherent to the nature of the role, or is it at all impacted by the Uber matching algorithm itself?\n\nMotivated by these questions, we want to dive deeper into the issue of driver equity, exploring through the driver's perspective how the design of matching algorithms can affect the efficiency and equity. Our deliverable will have two main components: 1) a literature review of existing ridesharing platforms and efforts at increasing driver satisfaction; 2) a novel algorithm implementation with simulation testing. We will spend significant time defining an application of the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm to this rideshare system matching problem, and we will compare the results of this to other algorithms, like random matching and closest neighbours.\n"

        "content": "\nTo begin, we want to better understand how the Uber system works and the general ride-sharing matching algorithm. Unfortunately, ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft are not required to share data like taxi services, so exact algorithms can not be found through literature, yet we will review work discussing the current research of these algorithms and what they aim to achieve (in most detail). In order to ground our knowledge of current work in the field to inform the design of our simulation, we conducted a preliminary literature review. Additionally, we will focus on the problems that these algorithms pose to the driver-side of the system: in particular, we will do brief literature review on the trade-offs between maximizing objectives in ride-share matching algorithms and driver revenue distribution. Next, we will look at how Uber and other ride-sharing companies generate matching algorithms to best generate aggregate revenue for the company, and how this may affect consumers of the app. Ultimately, we will use these insights to inform the design of our simulation and will aim to work towards a solution to various problems addressed, through our preference ordering and nuanced matching algorithm.\n\nA. Two-Sided Fairness Most ride-sharing platforms prioritize maximizing passenger satisfaction, as this is directly correlated with maximizing revenue. There is a trade-off between income distribution and maximizing the overall objective, which in this case is to maximize revenue of app and minimize the total distance covered by drivers. While existing platforms primarily prioritize customer satisfaction, S\u00a8uhr et al [1] emphasize the importance of considering fairness for drivers to ensure their well-being and long-term stability. The authors propose a framework for fair income distribution by amortizing equality over time, allowing drivers to receive benefits proportional to their active time on the platform. Specifically, the paper suggests algorithms that minimize income inequality while fairly distributing increases in customer waiting times. As we construct our own algorithm and analyze our results, we try to strike a balance between these two conflicting ideals, as we applied its concepts to a static matching problem rather than dynamic. [1]\nB. Preference-Aware Task Assignment Previous work in this field includes OSM-KIID [2], a model whose long-form name is Online Stable Matching under Known Identical Independent Distributions. In many matching problems, especially those constructed by commercial platforms like Uber, the aim is simply to maximize the profit of the system as a whole. This means that frequently, the individual preferences of parties on both sides are neglected, which in the short term might seem inconsequential but in the long term could have more drastic impacts, as participants may not longer feel that it is worthwhile to themselves to engage in the matching process. For example, in the rideshare system, if drivers feel as though their time and effort are not being compensated appropriately or they always get the least desired rides (like those that start or end in remote areas), then they may quit their job which is not good for the system as a whole. The authors of OSM-KIID seek to create a new model that takes into account both the overall revenue minimization objective as well as the preference satisfaction one, by maximizing revenue and minimizing blocking pairs. We incorporate this focus on preferences within our deferred acceptance algorithm, by taking into account factors like prior income distribution and desirability of starting and ending locations within the preference ordering generation. Additionally, we account for individual diversity of preferences by having unique cost coefficients among other nuances. [2]\n"

        "content": "\nThe Gale-Shapley algorithm, also known as deferred acceptance, results in a stable matching. This means that there is no blocking pair consisting of a passenger and driver who would prefer to be matched with each other than their current pairing, based on their preference ordering. Additionally, the Gale-Shapley algorithm is strategy-proof and optimal for the proposing side, which in this case consists of the drivers. This means that it is in the driver's best interest to report their honest attributes and preferences. Typically, the Gale-Shapley algorithm is not strategy-proof for the non-proposing side, and so there can be useful deviations for those entities. However, some concerns here are less relevant in this specific case, given the name of ridesharing requests. Since riders are currently in one specific location and want to get to another, then it would not make sense to misreport either of these values as then The area of greater concern could be in the underreporting of willingness-to-pay (WTP) by passengers, as if they are able to be still matched with this lower WTP then they would prefer to pay this lower amount if they are still completing their ride, and thus having the same utility. We could potentially fix this by having the payment amount be a critical value rather than a fixed WTP, such that below this point, the ride would not be completed and the passenger would not derive any utility.\n\nWe can make our algorithm more equitable if drivers care less about the drop-off location's distance from the center. If drivers are willing to prioritize passengers that are farther away, then this would help overall driver income equity but it would hurt the company's overall revenue.\n"

The stochasticity of \u03b1 denotes that different riders may have different tradeoffs and demand factors that are outside of our current scope, naively capturing different people's frugality. We calculated the Passenger willingness ot pay like this to demonstrate that passengers are willing to pay more for longer rides, as well as rides that make the driver go more out of the way (rides that begin and end farther from the city center).\n\nSimilarly, each driver's cost is a function of their total trip length and distance from the city center, multiplied by a personal cost coefficient.\n\n$${\\mathsf{c o s t}}=\\gamma({\\mathsf{t r i p L e n g t h}}+{\\mathsf{c i t y C e n t e r D i s t}})$$\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1] is a cost coefficient randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution, rideLength is the sum of the Manhattan distances from the driver's current location to the passenger pickup location and the passenger's pickup to dropoff locations, and cityCenterDist is the Euclidean distance of the dropoff locations from the city center. The cost coefficient of \u03b3 denotes that different drivers may have cost factors that are outside of our current scope.\n\nWhile our riders simply post their WTP, our drivers must take into consideration the difference between a rider's WTP and the cost of the trip. In other words, we have simplified market equilibrium dynamics to be constrained to just driverside profit and utility. Our drivers have higher costs for longer drives, as well as drives that result in them being father away from the city center that would limit their ability to pick up new rides.\n"

In our project, we experiment with these hyperparameters for how much weight should be placed on these different factors to achieve the best results. Here, lower preference scores are prioritized.\n\nDrivers take into account two factors: profit and distance from the city center. Normalizing either factor, driver d calculates the following preference score for a passenger p:\n\n$pref_{d}(p)=-$ p.WTP + $w_{p}$d.cost(p)\n\nd.cost(p) =$\\alpha$(d.pickupDist(p))\n\n+ 0.1 * (d.cityCenterDist(p))^2\nwhere wp is a randomly generated gaussian random variable with mean = 1 and SD = 0.2 to demonstrate that different drivers value cost of the drive different from each other. d.pickupDist(p) is the manhattan distance between the driver and passenger's pickup location and d.cityCenterDist(p) is the euclidean distance between the passenger's dropoff location and the city center, normalized. Drivers prioritize rides that earn them more money, which is why we add the WTP of the passenger (the whole function is flipped by the negative since sorting in python sorts smallest to largest), while they also want rides with the smallest cost to them possible.\n\nPassengers also take into account two factors when ordering drivers: wait time and the driver's current aggregate income. This is where our system attempts to implement income equity among the drivers. By adding this factor into the preference orders, the system allows drivers with lower aggregate income in the current period to get higher priority in matching, thus hypothetically promoting greater ride equity. We will test whether this is a plausible solution or not in the simulation. Normalizing either factor, passenger p calculates the following preference score for a passenger d:\n\n$pref_{p}(d)=$$w_{t}($waitLength(p,d)$)$\n\n$+$$w_{t}($agIncome(d)$)$\nwhere wt is the weight applied to the pickup wait time (which, due to our unit time per distance, is just the Manhattan distance between the driver's current location and the passenger's requested pickup location) and wi is the weight applied to the driver's aggregate income thus far. When the system does not take into consider income distribution, we set wt = 1 and wi = 0. We hypothesize that the greater the wi, the more equitable our overall income distribution, at the tradeoff of our aggregate system revenue.\n"

Of interest to us is implementing a dynamic or competitive pricing model, where prices increase if demand is greater than the supply, such as through origin-based surge pricing.
