Weintraub, and Meir Pachter\n\n  Abstract\u2014 In classical works on a planar differential pursuit-\nevasion game with a faster pursuer, the intercept point resulting\nfrom the equilibrium strategies lies on the Apollonius circle.\nThis property was exploited for the construction of the equi-\nlibrium strategies for two faster pursuers against one evader.\nExtensions for planar multiple-pursuer single-evader scenarios\nhave been considered. We study a pursuit-evasion game on\na sphere and the relation of the equilibrium intercept point\nto the Apollonius domain on the sphere. The domain is a\ngeneralization of the planar Apollonius circle set. We find\na condition resulting in the intercept point belonging to the\nApollonius domain, which is the characteristic of the planar\ngame solution. Finally, we use this characteristic to discuss\npursuit and evasion strategies in the context of two pursuers\nand a single slower evader on the sphere and illustrate it using\nnumerical simulations.\n\n          I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\n  The Apollonius circle is a concept that has been used\nto address solutions of multiple non-cooperative pursuit-\nevasion (P-E) differential games under simple motion in the\nplane [1]. It is the set of points that can be reached by\nE sooner than P, i.e., it is the dominance region of E. In\nthe same reference [1], the solution of the two pursuer and\nsingle slower evader differential game is inferred from the\nintersection of Apollonius circles. The problem was revisited\nand solved in [2] and the Apollonius circle construct was\napplied as a building block for the solution of a game with\nmultiple pursuers [3] in the plane. For P-E differential games\non a sphere with a slower E, the dominance of E is not a\ncircle [4], therefore, we denote it as the Apollonius domain.\n\nThis paper investigates the P-E game of min-max capture time equilibrium strategies on a sphere for a slower E and simple motion of both players, and examines their outcome against the Apollonius domain. In the planar case, the intercept point resulting from equilibrium strategies lies on the Apollonius circle, and here we investigate conditions This paper is based on work performed at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) *Control Science Center* and is supported by AFOSR LRIR 24RQCOR002.

Under these conditions, we discuss P-E strategies for games on a sphere with multiple Ps and a single E in a similar fashion as in [3].\n\nRelated works: If two players move in a plane and when both of them apply their equilibrium strategies, the corresponding equilibrium trajectories are straight lines. As pointed out in [5] when a pursuer and an evader have simple motion over a 2D Riemannian manifolds, the same holds when the players are sufficiently close, except that instead of straight lines, the trajectories are along manifold shortest paths, i.e., geodesics. However, when the players are far from each other, there may be multiple geodesics of the same length, which requires an additional analysis. Using this perspective, the authors in [5], [6] analyzed multiple manifolds, but not a sphere. Note that when P and E are on the opposite sides of a sphere and on the same line with the center of the sphere, there are infinitely many geodesics between P and E. The P-E game on a sphere was the topic of [4], but under the condition that P always knows E's velocity. Another related paper is [7] which discusses sufficient conditions for a P-E solution. A P-E on a sphere also appears in popular culture [8] in a graphic novel, in which, on a very small planet, the main character, Goku, must catch a pet monkey, Bubbles, to prove he is worthy to be trained by Master Kai.\n\nSince the P-E solution in this paper results in feedback strategies for P and E, it is worth pointing to other works on feedback control on a sphere. These include the stabilization of collective motion [9], motion coordination in a spatiotemporal flow-field [10], the control of multi agents on a sphere to achieve different spherical patterns [11] and consensus on a sphere [12], the stabilization of bilinear systems [13] and collision-free motion coordination using barrier functions [14].\n\nPaper contributions: We revisit here the problem of P-E\non a sphere, in which P and a slower E have simple motion. Our analysis relies on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation\n(HJI), which allows us to derive equilibrium strategies for both players, except for a special game configuration in which there are infinitely many geodesics connecting P and E. The special configuration is the one in which P and E are on the opposite sides of the sphere and on the same line with the center of the sphere. Due to the multiplicity of solutions, the condition of the game is similar to the presence of the dilemma. Therefore, we use the value function and associated rate of loss [15], which allows us to obtain unique equilibrium strategies on the whole sphere surface. With this, we also obtain the corresponding intercept point and using results from [4], we are able to obtain the condition resulting in the intercept point in the Apollonius domain.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. The problem formulation in Section II is followed by the P-E game analysis and equilibrium strategies in Section III. Section IV is about a relation between the intercept point resulting from the equilibrium strategies and the Apollonius domain. Section V shows examples illustrating paper results and Section VI gives conclusions.\n"

        "content": "\nConsider two agents restricted to motion on a spherical surface, see Fig. 1: a pursuer (P) and a slower evader (E).\n\nBoth P and E move on the spherical surface and their positions are defined as the corresponding vectors\n\n$$\\vec{P}=R\\cos\\varphi_{P}\\cos\\theta_{P}\\vec{i}+R\\cos\\varphi_{P}\\sin\\theta_{P}\\vec{j}+R\\sin\\varphi_{P}\\vec{k},$$ $$\\vec{E}=R\\cos\\varphi_{E}\\cos\\theta_{E}\\vec{i}+R\\cos\\varphi_{E}\\sin\\theta_{E}\\vec{j}+R\\sin\\varphi_{E}\\vec{k}.\\tag{1}$$\n\nDue to their constrained motion on the sphere's surface, the vectors $\\vec{E}$ and $\\vec{P}$ defining the positions of $E$ and $P$ always have the same magnitudes $|\\vec{E}|=|\\vec{P}|=R$ (see Fig. 1). The velocities $\\vec{v}_{E}$ and $\\vec{v}_{P}$ of $E$ and $P$, respectively, are\n\n$$\\vec{v}_{E}=v_{E}\\vec{e},0\\leq v_{E}\\leq\\mu v_{P}\\tag{2}$$ $$\\vec{v}_{P}=v_{P}\\vec{p},v_{P}=\\mbox{const},0<\\mu<1,\\tag{3}$$\nwhere \u20d7e and \u20d7p are unit vectors tangential to the sphere representing the agent's direction of travel, and vE and vP\nrepresenting the corresponding speed; this implies \u20d7vE \u00b7 \u20d7E =\n\u20d7vP \u00b7 \u20d7P = 0.\n\nThe control variable of P is only the velocity direction \u20d7p, while the control variables of E are both the speed vE and the velocity direction \u20d7e. The speed ratio \u00b5 \u2208 (0, 1) is the ratio of E's maximal speed and P's speed vP ; therefore, P\nis faster than E.\n\nP-E game: The two agents are initially at different locations of the sphere and when P *is collocated with* E, we say that P has *captured* E. The capture time \u03c4 is the length of time that it takes P and E to move from their initial positions to when P captures E, or formally\n\n$$\\tau=\\inf\\{t\\mid\\vec{E}=\\vec{P}\\}.\\tag{4}$$\nThe goal of P is to select its sequence of actions to minimize the capture time, while the goal of E is to select its sequence of actions that will maximize the capture time.\n\nProblem: We analyze here the pursuit evasion problem on the sphere and find the equilibrium (i.e., the saddle point or Nash-equilibrium) strategies {\u20d7v\u2217\nP ,\u20d7v\u2217\nE} for P and E, respectively. They are optimal in a sense that if both P\nand E commit to them, then the capture time is \u03c4 \u2217(\u20d7v\u2217\nP ,\u20d7v\u2217\nE).\n\nHowever, if P (E) gives up its equilibrium strategy and applies any other action at any time point, it will extend (shorten) time to capture. This can be expressed as\n\n$$\\tau(\\vec{v}_{P}^{*},\\vec{v}_{E})\\leq\\tau^{*}(\\vec{v}_{P}^{*},\\vec{v}_{E}^{*})\\leq\\tau(\\vec{v}_{P},\\vec{v}_{E}^{*}).\\tag{5}$$\n\nThe capture time $\\tau^{*}$ is also called the Value of the game. Our goal is to find equilibrium strategies for $P$ and $E$, as well as the Value function. Then we will examine the relative position between the equilibrium intercept point (i.e., the intercept point resulting from both players applying their equilibrium strategies) and the Apollonius domain, which is defined as follows.\n\n_Definition 1: Apollonius domain $\\mathcal{A}$_. Let us assume that at the initial time $t=0$, the positions of $P$ and $E$ on a sphere are $P(0)$ and $E(0)$, $P(0)\\neq E(0)$. The Apollonius domain, $\\mathcal{A}$, is a closed set of points $I$ on the sphere defined as\n\n$$\\mathcal{A}=\\left\\{I\\ |\\ \\widehat{\\widehat{E}(0)}\\leq\\widehat{\\widehat{IP}(0)}\\over v_{P}}\\right\\},\\tag{6}$$\n\nwhere $\\widehat{IE}(0),\\widehat{IP}(0)$ are lengths of arcs from $E(0)$ and $P(0)$ to $I$, respectively, while $\\widehat{IE}(0)/\\mu v_{P}$ and $\\widehat{IP}(0)/v_{P}$ are the corresponding times for $E$ and $P$ to reach $I$ using their maximal speeds.\n"

The goal of $P$ is to minimize $J$, i.e., time to capture and the goal of $E$ is to maximize it. Theorem 1 defines equilibrium strategies for $P$ and $E$ and their relative angular distance $\\alpha\\in(0,\\pi)$. This is followed by Lemma 1 about the case $\\alpha=\\pi$ and all the \nresults are summarized in Theorem 2 providing equilibrium strategies for P-E relative positions \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03c0].\n\nTheorem 1. For the P-E game on a sphere with agent\nkinematics (8)-(9)*, time to capture cost* (11) and\n(a) The relative angular position between P and E is\n\u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) *and obeys* (10)\n(b) P has constant speed vP , the control variable is heading uP \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) and the goal to minimize the time to\ncapture\n(c) The control variables for E are speed vE \u2208 [0*, \u00b5v*P ]\nand heading uE \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), and E has the goal to\nmaximize the time to capture,\nthe saddle point equilibrium strategies for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) are\ndefined by\n$u_{P}=0$ and $(v_{E},u_{E})=(\\mu v_{P},0)$. (12)\nMoreover, if both players are at the relative angular position\n\u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) and follow their equilibrium strategies, the time to capture is\n\n$$V(\\alpha)=R\\alpha((1-\\mu)v_{P})^{-1}.\\tag{13}$$\n\nProof: The equilibrium strategies satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation\n\n$$\\min_{u_{P}}\\max_{(v_{E},u_{E})}\\left\\{\\left(\\frac{v_{E}}{R}\\cos u_{E}-\\frac{v_{P}}{R}\\cos u_{P}\\right)\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\alpha}+1\\right\\}=0,\\tag{14}$$\n\nwhere $V(\\alpha)$ is the Value of the game (see Remark 1), the minimization is over the variable $u_{P}$ defining the heading of $P$ and the maximization is over the speed $v_{E}$ and variable $u_{E}$ defining the heading of $E$. When the min and max operators are applied, we obtain\n\n$$\\max_{(v_{E},u_{E})}\\left\\{\\frac{v_{E}}{R}\\cos u_{E}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\alpha}\\right\\}+\\min_{u_{P}}\\left\\{-\\frac{v_{P}}{R}\\cos u_{P}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\alpha}\\right\\}+1=0.\\tag{15}$$\n\nThe fact that max and min operators are separable reinforces that the strategies in (14) are saddle point strategies. The game is defined over variable $\\alpha$ and since $\\alpha=0$ corresponds to the capture, we know that $V(0)=0$. Also, we know that for an incrementally larger angular distance $\\alpha\\in(0,\\pi)$, the game lasts incrementally longer, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\alpha}>0$. Therefore, we can conclude.\n\n\u2202\u03b1 > 0.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude\n\n- min in the second term of (15) is achieved for uP = 0,\nwhich is the equilibrium P strategy for \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03c0)\n* max in the first term of (15) is achieved for $v_{E}=\\mu v_{P}$, $u_{E}=0$, which is the equilibrium $E$ strategy for $\\alpha\\in(0,\\pi)$.\n\n_These facts prove the equilibrium actions in (12)_.\n\nWhen we substitute the equilibrium strategies in (15), we obtain\n\n$$\\frac{\\mu v_{P}}{R}\\,\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\alpha}\\,-\\,\\frac{v_{P}}{R}\\,\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\alpha}+1=0.$$\n\nRe-arranging, we obtain\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\alpha}=\\frac{R}{(1-\\mu)v_{P}}.$$\n\nFinally, since $V(0)=0$, we can conclude that\n\n$$V(\\alpha)=\\frac{R\\alpha}{(1-\\mu)v_{P}},$$\nwhich is (13) and that concludes our proof. Remark 1. The cost function resulting from both agents following their equilibrium strategies is also called the Value of the game, hence the symbol V in (13).\n\nIn Lemma 1, we discuss the special case when the game starts from the initial position \u03b1\n=\n\u03c0. In this case, the great circle is not well defined and there are infinitely many great circles that go through P and E, yet the angular distance \u03b1 measured along any of them is \u03b1 = \u03c0. Remark 2. The essential problem with \u03b1 = \u03c0 is that without a well-defined great circle, there are no reference directions for measuring angles uE and uP .\n\nLemma 1. For all conditions of Theorem 1, except (a)\nwhich is replaced with (a\u2032): the relative position \u03b1 = \u03c0, the equilibrium actions for P and E are\n\n$$u_{P}=\\text{any direction}\\tag{16}$$ $$(v_{E},u_{E})=(0,u_{E}),\\quad u_{E}\\in[0,2\\pi),\\tag{17}$$\n\n_where $u_{E}$ is measured with respect to a great circle aligned with the direction of motion selected by $P$. The equilibrium action for $E$ corresponds to_\n\n$$\\min_{v_{E}}\\max_{u_{E}}\\mathcal{L}(v_{E},u_{E})=\\max_{u_{E}}\\min_{v_{E}}\\mathcal{L}(v_{E},u_{E})=\\tfrac{\\mu}{1-\\mu},$$ $$\\mathcal{L}(v_{E},u_{E})=\\frac{\\mu-\\frac{v_{E}}{v_{P}}\\cos u_{E}}{1-\\mu},v_{E}\\in[0,\\mu v_{P}],u_{E}\\in[0,2\\pi).$$\n\nProof.: Due to infinitely many great circles that we can consider to measure $\\alpha$, we are free to take the one which is aligned with the selected direction of motion by $P$. Because of that, whatever direction is selected by $P$, its $u_{P}=0$ since the adopted great circle is aligned with its motion, but $u_{E}$ has to be also measured with respect to the same great circle. The relative angle on the adopted great circle for $\\alpha=\\pi$ satisfies\n\n$$\\dot{\\alpha}=\\tfrac{v_{E}}{R}\\cos u_{E}-\\tfrac{v_{P}}{R}<0,\\tag{18}$$\n\nwhich follows from $v_{E}\\leq\\mu v_{P}$ and $0<\\mu<1\\Rightarrow v_{E}<v_{P}$. In other words, on the adopted great circle where $u_{P}=0$ and for $\\alpha(0)=\\pi$, any action of $E$ results in\n\n$$(v_{E},u_{E})\\in\\{[0,\\mu v_{P}]\\times[0,2\\pi)\\}\\Rightarrow\\alpha(0^{+})<\\pi,\\tag{19}$$\nand we can conclude that at t = 0+, the great circle is well defined. Consequently, for any *t >* 0+, both P and E\ncan follow their equilibrium strategies from Theorem 1 since \u03b1(t) *< \u03c0* for all *t >* 0+.\n\nHowever, for t = 0 and the adopted great circle (uP = 0)\nin (18), we can only state that uE \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) which is measured with respect to the adopted great circle. It is because the adopted great circle, i.e., the direction of motion selected by P is unknown to E. Therefore, whatever heading direction is selected by E, the best we can say is that uE \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). To find equilibrium actions at t = 0, we will use the rate-of-loss analysis [15] which starts with the following reasoning.\n\nLet us assume that at t = 0, \u03b1(0) = \u03c0 and both P and E commit their control variable selections that hold for a very short (hold time) time h \u2248 0, *h >* 0. As was previously discussed, due to the adopted great circle at t = 0, we always have uP = 0; therefore after h, the value \u03b1(h) is\n\n$$\\alpha(h)=\\pi+{\\frac{v_{E}h\\cos u_{E}}{R}}-{\\frac{v_{P}h}{R}}<\\pi-{\\frac{v_{P}-v_{E}}{R}}h<\\pi.$$\nSince \u03b1(h) *< \u03c0*, Theorem 1 provides strategies for both P\nand E, and the resulting time to capture is h + V (\u03b1(h)), which depends on where \u03b1 landed after the initial hold time h. In general, h+V (\u03b1(h)) can be different from V (\u03b1(0)). To measure that discrepancy as h \u2192 0, we use the instantaneous rate-of-loss\n\nh (20) L = \u2212 lim h\u21920 V (\u03b1(h)) \u2212 V (\u03b1(0)) + h R ) \ufffd \ufffd R(\u03c0 + vEh cos uE\u2212vP h = \u2212 lim h\u21920 1 h (1 \u2212 \u00b5)vP \u2212 R\u03c0 (1 \u2212 \u00b5)vP + h = \u2212vE cos uE \u2212 vP 1\u2212\u00b5 vP cos uE \ufffd \u00b5 \u2212 vE \ufffd \u2265 0. (1 \u2212 \u00b5)vP \u2212 1 = 1 (21)\nThis is the rate-of-loss from the prospective of E. Its loss is reflected in the shortening of its time to capture, hence we included the \"\u2013\" sign in front of the limit of (20) to be able to discuss the rate-of-loss in terms of a non-negative value.\n\nIn expression (21), the rate of loss L = L(vE, uE) and for any vE \u2208 [0*, \u00b5v*P ] the maximum of loss L(vE, uE)\ncorresponds to uE = \u2212\u03c0, i.e.,\n\n1\u2212\u00b5 vP \ufffd \u00b5 + vE \ufffd . max uE L(vE, uE) = 1 1\u2212\u00b5 (22)\nWe focus on this max of the rate-of-loss as the worst case scenario since uE does not know the selected direction of movement by P, i..e, the orientation of the adopted great circle. This max increases with vE, so the only way that E\ncan minimize it is to select vE = 0 and we can conclude that min vE max uE L(vE, uE) =\n\u00b5\ncorresponds to action (0, uE), uE = [0, 2\u03c0), which proves the property of the equilibrium action for E in (17).\n\nAlternately, rather than first minimizing over uE, if we initially apply minimization over vE from (21), we obtain\n\nvP cos uE 1\u2212\u00b5 , cos uE \u2265 0 vP cos uE l2 = \u00b5\u2212 0 min vE L(vE, uE) = \uf8f1 \uf8f2 1\u2212\u00b5 , cos uE < 0. \uf8f3 l1 = \u00b5\u2212 \u00b5vP\nThen, when we apply max over uE \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), we see that l1 reaches the max value l1 =\n\u00b5\n1\u2212\u00b5, but only if uE = \u03c0/2.\n\nSince E does not know the orientation of the adopted great circle, it cannot use that value. On the other hand, the max value l2 =\n\u00b5\n\n           1\u2212\u00b5 is reached not only for cos uE < 0, but for\nany angle uE \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). From this and (22), we can finally\nconclude that the equilibrium action for E which is (0, uE),\nuE \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) corresponds to the saddle point\n\n$$\\min_{v_{E}}\\max_{u_{E}}\\mathcal{L}(v_{E},u_{E})=\\max_{u_{E}}\\min_{v_{E}}\\mathcal{L}(v_{E},u_{E})=\\frac{\\mu}{1-\\mu},\\tag{23}$$\nwhich proves (1) and with this, we conclude our proof.\n\nWe finish this section with Theorem 2 which summarizes results from Theorem 1 and Lemma 1.\n\n**Theorem 2**.: _For all conditions of Theorem 1 except (a) which is replaced with $(a^{\\prime\\prime})$: all possible relative positions $\\alpha\\in(0,\\pi]$, the equilibrium actions for $P$ and $E$ are_\n\n$$u_{P}=\\begin{cases}0,&\\alpha\\in(0,\\pi)\\\\ \\text{any direction},&\\alpha=\\pi\\end{cases}\\tag{24}$$ $$(v_{E},u_{E})=\\begin{cases}(\\mu v_{P},0),&\\alpha\\in(0,\\pi)\\\\ (0,\\text{any direction}),&\\alpha=\\pi.\\end{cases}\\tag{25}$$\n\n_For any initial condition $\\alpha\\in(0,\\pi]$, and $P$ and $E$ following their equilibrium strategies, the time to capture is_\n\n$$\\tau\\leq V(\\alpha)=\\frac{R\\alpha}{(1-\\mu)v_{P}},\\quad\\text{for}\\alpha\\neq\\pi,\\tag{26}$$\nand for \u03b1 = \u03c0 the difference\n\n$V(\\pi)-\\tau=\\varepsilon>0$, (27)\nwhere \u03b5 is an infinitesimally small value, \u03b5 \u2192 0.\n\nProof. The equilibrium actions in (24) and (25) follow directly from Theorem 1 and Lemma 1 covering the cases\n\u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) and \u03b1 = \u03c0, respectively. In (17), Lemma 1\nstates that uE \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) and here we restate it as uE = any direction since the range for uE covers all possible angles. Also note that the angle uE is measured with respect to the great circle aligned with the direction of movement selected by P, which can also take any direction. This justifies that instead of referring to a range, Theorem 2 states that uE =\nany direction. With this, we conclude the discussion of (24) and (25) in this proof.\n\nWith regard to (26), in Theorem 1 we already proved that for \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) the equality in (26) holds. Therefore, we only need to prove that for \u03b1 = \u03c0 the time to capture \u03c4 satisfies\n\n$\\tau\\leq V(\\pi)=\\frac{R\\pi}{(1-\\mu)v_{P}}$. (28)\nFor \u03b1 = \u03c0 in (20)\u2013(21) of the Lemma 1 proof, we use the rate-of-loss\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(v_{E},u_{E})=-\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{V(\\alpha(h))-V(\\alpha(0))+h}{h}\\tag{29}$$ $$=\\frac{1}{1-\\mu}\\left(\\mu-\\frac{v_{E}}{v_{P}}\\cos u_{E}\\right),\\tag{30}$$\n\nwhere $h>0$ is an infinitesimal hold time, $h\\to0$. Let us rewrite (29) for $\\alpha(0)=\\pi$ as\n\n$$V(\\pi)-(V(\\alpha(h))+h)=h\\mathcal{L}(0,u_{E}),h\\to0,\\tag{31}$$\nand recognize that for the equilibrium action of P, \u03b1(h) < \u03c0 which follows from (19). Furthermore, if both P and E follow their equilibrium strategies for all *t > h*, V (\u03b1(h)) is the exact time until the capture. Therefore, the time to capture from t = 0 is \u03c4 = V (\u03b1(h)) + h which we substitute in (31) together with L(0, uE) =\n\u00b5\n1\u2212\u00b5 to obtain\n\u03c4 = V (\u03c0) \u2212 h\n\u00b5\n1\u2212\u00b5, h \u2192 0 \u21d2 \u03c4 \u2264 V (\u03c0),\n(32)\na set of intercept points I\u03bb satisfying |\u2322\nPI\u03bb|/\u03b4(\u03bb) = \u00b5, where \u03b4(\u03bb) and\n|\u2322\nPI\u03bb| are distances from E and P to I\u03bb, respectively. There is one-to-one correspondence between the angle \u03bb and the distance \u03b4(\u03bb).\n\nwhich proves (28) and consequently (26). The same expression yields\n\n$$V(\\pi)-\\tau=\\underbrace{h\\frac{\\mu}{1-\\mu}}_{\\varepsilon},\\ h\\to0,\\tag{33}$$\n\nwhere the $\\varepsilon$ expression on the right is an infinitesimally small value, which proves (27) and concludes our proof.\n"

The angle \u03bb is measured with respect to the great circle defined by P and E, and it is known by P at t = 0 as well. Using this information, P\ncan take the *shortest path* to intercept E at the point I\u03bb.\n\nThe arc length from E to I\u03bb is \u03b4 = |\u2322\nthe arc length from P to I\u03bb is |\u2322 EI\u03bb| = \u00b5vP \u03c4\u03bb while PI\u03bb| = vP \u03c4\u03bb, where \u03c4\u03bb\nis the time of the intercept. Note that all points on the arc\n\u2322\nEI\u03bb are points that E can reach sooner than P; similarly,\n\u2322\nPI\u03bb are points that P can reach sooner than E. We can sweep the angle \u03bb \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) over its full range, and it will produce a closed line of I\u03bb points. Points inside (outside)\nof the line are all points that E (P) can reach sooner. The points inside the line form the Apollonius domain A and the boundary of the domain \u2202A is a line which P and E\ncan reach simultaneously, therefore, it is a set of potential intercept points from the initial configuration.\n\nIt is shown in [4] that\n\n$$\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{R\\mu}\\right)=\\cos\\frac{\\delta}{R}\\cos\\alpha+\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\lambda\\sin\\frac{\\delta}{R},\\tag{34}$$\n\nand that this implicit relation describes a one-to-one $\\delta(\\lambda)$ mapping between $\\lambda$ and $\\delta$ which is dependent on $\\alpha$.

Since \u00b5 < 1, the condition (39) implies that \u03b1(0) <\n\u03c0. Therefore, the equilibrium actions for both E and P are\nuE = 0 and uP = 0. With uE = 0, E moves in the direction\n\u03bb = \u03c0 and the intercept point is on the great circle defined\nby P and E. The time to capture is (see Theorem 2)\n\n$$\\tau=V(\\alpha(0))=\\frac{R\\alpha(0)}{(1-\\mu)_{VP}}.\\tag{40}$$\n\nTherefore, the arc length traveled by $E$ is\n\n$$\\widehat{EI}_{P-E}=\\frac{R\\mu_{P}\\alpha(0)}{(1-\\mu)_{VP}}=\\frac{R\\mu\\alpha(0)}{(1-\\mu)},\\tag{41}$$\n\nwhich is a value independent of $\\alpha_{c}$.

First let us define the evader's dominance region as E = A1\u2229A2, where A1 and A2 are the Apollonius domains associated with pursuers P1 and P2, respectively.\n\nThe set E represents the set of points that the evader can reach before either pursuer. With the evader at the north pole, let \u03b11 and \u03b12 denote the latitude offset for the pursuers, and let \u03bbo be the longitudinal offset between the pursuers. The agents' speeds are such that \u00b51 =\nvE\nvP1 , \u00b52 =\nvE\nvP2 < 1.\n\nLet the point IP1\u2212E be the equilibrium intercept point for the one-on-one game between P1 and E (and let IP2\u2212E be defined similarly for P2).\n\nProposition 1: _In the two-pursuer scenario with $\\alpha_{1}<\\pi(1-\\mu_{1})$ and $\\alpha_{2}<\\pi(1-\\mu_{2})$ (i.e., the pursuers are sufficiently close to the evader), the intercept point associated with the solution for the game of $\\min$-$\\max$ capture time is_\n\n$$I^{*}=\\begin{cases}I_{P_{1}-E},&I_{P_{1}-E}\\in\\mathcal{A}_{2}\\\\ I_{P_{2}-E},&I_{P_{2}-E}\\in\\mathcal{A}_{1}\\\\ \\max\\left\\{\\widehat{EI}\\mid I\\in\\partial\\mathcal{A}_{1}\\cap\\partial\\mathcal{A}_{2}\\right\\},&\\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}\\tag{46}$$\n\nIn any case, the agents' equilibrium strategy is to take a geodesic path to the equilibrium intercept point $I^{*}$ as described in (46). This is due to the fact that $I^{*}\\in\\partial\\mathcal{A}_{1}\\cup\\partial\\mathcal{A}_{2}$\nand all of the points on the boundary of an Apollonius domain are, by definition, points of simultaneous arrival via geodesic paths (i.e., see [4]). Note that the state space for Proposition 1 is restricted such that the geodesic distances from the pursuers to the evader satisfy (39). This is because for *\u03b1 > \u03b1*C the Apollonius domain A does not contain the equilibrium intercept point for the min-max capture time game, and thus E may not necessarily be guaranteed to contain the equilibrium intercept point for the two-pursuer version of the game. A rigorous proof for Proposition 1, as well as the solution for more general two-pursuer initial conditions is left for future work.\n"

The evader wins if it can safely reach a point in the target region while the pursuer(s) wins if capture occurs before the evader can reach the target. Let the target region be a subset of the surface of the sphere denoted as T .\n\nLemma 2. In the spherical target guarding game with one evader and one or more faster pursuers, the evader wins if A \u2229 T \u0338= \u2205.\n\nLemma 3.

From [4, Proposition 4.6], under the condition (47) if the pursuer uses the *geodesic parallel strategy*, the Apollonius domain at the initial time is guaranteed to contain the Apollonius domain at all future times until capture for any evader's motion consisting of a polygonal line of geodesic arcs. Thus, if *A \u2229 T* = \u2205 in the initial configuration, the condition is guaranteed to hold over the playout of the game. Moreover, from [4, Corollary to Proposition 4.7] capture is guaranteed to occur within a time of\n\u03b1\n1\u2212\u00b5. Therefore, the evader's safe reachable set will never intersect the target region, capture is guaranteed in a finite time, and thus the evader will not be able to win.\n"

        "content": "\nThis paper contains the solution to the pursuit-evasion differential game of min-max capture time between one pursuer and one slower evader, all moving with simple motion on a sphere. In the special case where the two agents are on direct opposite ends of the sphere, the agents' equilibrium strategies are not well defined according to the conventional analysis; this configuration lies on a Dispersal Surface. A loss-rate analysis was carried out in this paper to determine a unique equilibrium control input for this configuration which involves the evader standing still for an infinitesimally small amount of time while the pursuer freely chooses any heading. The solution of the game provides a spherical analogue to the Apollonius circle, i.e., the Apollonius domain. It was found that the equilibrium intercept point lies outside the Apollonius domain in a portion of the state space (unlike in the planar case). Consequently, when the initial configuration lies within a specified parameter regime, the Apollonius domain exhibits similar properties to the Apollonius circle, i.e., the sphere can be considered flat. This is due to the geometry of a sphere, which is a closed domain, rather than an open domain of a Cartesian plane. Therefore, some caution must be taken when applying the concept of the Apollonius domain to solve spherical pursuitevasion problems. Some example extensions and applications were discussed, including two cooperative pursuers and target guarding. Future work includes rigorously proving the two-pursuer solution, generalizing it, and obtaining evader reachability sets when the pursuer does not know the evader's heading. Establishing dominance regions for multi-pursuerevader scenarios on spherical geometry remains to be a rich area of research.\n"
