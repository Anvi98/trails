        "title": "A Benchmark For The Application Of Distributed Control Techniques To The Electricity Network Of The European Economic Area",
        "content": "\nA. Riccardi, L. Laurenti, and B. De Schutter Abstract The European Economic Area Electricity Network Benchmark (EEA-ENB) is a multi-area power system representing the European network of transmission systems for electricity to facilitate the application of distributed control techniques. In the EEA-ENB we consider the Load Frequency Control (LFC) problem in the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs), and energy storage systems (ESSs). RESs are known to cause instability in power networks due to their inertia-less and intermittent characteristics, while ESSs are introduced as a resource to mitigate the problem. In the EEA-ENB, particular attention is dedicated to Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC), whose application is often limited to small and homogeneous test cases due to the lack of standardized large-scale scenarios for testing, and due to the large computation time required to obtain a centralized MPC action for performance comparison with DMPC strategies under consideration. The second problem is exacerbated when the scale of the system grows. To address these challenges and to provide a real-world-based and control-independent benchmark, the EEA-ENB has been developed. The benchmark includes a centralized MPC strategy providing performance and computation time metrics to compare distributed control within a repeatable and realistic simulation environment.\n\nA.

        "title": "1 Introduction 1.1 The Origin Of The Benchmark: Motivation And Challenges",
        "content": "\nThe European Economic Area Electricity Network Benchmark (EEA-ENB) is a benchmark designed for the implementation and testing of distributed control strategies for large-scale power networks. The idea behind the benchmark is to build an abstract model of the European network of transmission systems for electricity. We represent each country of the European economic area as an independent electrical area connected to others through tie lines according to a predefined electricity network topology. The result is a real-world oriented benchmark that accounts for the presence of renewable generation and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) in the load-frequency control (LFC) problem of the power network.\n\nThe development of the EEA-ENB is essential because no established control model for the European electricity transmission system consistently serves as a reference for distributed control techniques, especially with energy storage systems and renewable energy sources. Additionally, the use case for the EEA-ENB is not restricted only to the pure development of control strategies. With minimal modifications, it can also be used for other applications, such as the economic optimization of network operation, the study of network expansion strategies, testing of security and privacy features, and simulation of emergency situations such as cascading blackouts and network restoration.\n\nTo assess the time and computation requirements for the implementation of a distributed control strategy we implement centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) on the network. Together with the value of the cost function of centralized MPC developed, this provides the user metrics to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages in the implementation of a specific distributed control technique. The EEA-ENB is formulated with a modular approach such that extensions can be implemented if needed, allowing for various application scenarios as mentioned before. The stability of the network is assessed through the study of the Load Frequency Control (LFC) problem. Moreover, another application that is particularly relevant for this benchmark is the economical optimization of energy trading among network agents. The EEA-ENB can also be employed to formulate Distributed MPC (DMPC) techniques in the presence of hybrid dynamics thanks to a modified ESS dynamics reported.\n\nAdditional extensions, not included in this work, include the characterization of each electrical area according to the deregulated energy market through the modeling of generation plants, the auction system for scheduling energy production across the various generation companies, and the market of power exchanges between different electrical areas [4].\n\nThe main challenge in controlling the EEA-ENB has to be sought in its scale: 26\nelectrical areas are considered, each subject to distinct variations in load requests and renewable generation. When using a growing number of control agents the computation time of a centralized control action becomes increasingly prohibitive, thus, distributed control approaches are required.\n"

        "title": "1.2 Load Frequency Control In Modern Power Networks",
        "content": "\nTheLFC problemis acrucial challengein powersystems,and ithas aparticular socioeconomic interest [15]. The LFC problem gained interest in the research community in the 1970s [9] after some major systems events led to cascading blackouts [12]. These problems typically arise when unexpected changes in the load of a power system occur, with consequent shifts in the operating frequency of the electrical area under consideration, and the propagation of this effect to neighboring areas. In the last decades cascading blackouts have been exacerbated by the increasing diffusion of renewable energy sources, which are posing new challenges for LFC of interconnected power grids due to their intermittent and stochastic nature, and inertia-less generation [20].\n\nNowadays, new strategies to increase network robustness are constantly sought\n[4]. This is the reason why ESSs are fundamental in modern energy grids: they allow for more efficient use of energy, optimizing its usage based on the demand, and they can be used to counteract the inertia-less properties of renewable energy sources. Therefore, part of the modeling section of this chapter is dedicated to ESSs, from the simplest dynamical formulation to more complex hybrid formulations.\n\nFormally, the main control problem solved in the EEA-ENB is the regulation to zero of the frequency deviation of the network from the nominal value. This problem is solved in the presence of unexpected changes in the load, renewable generation, and ESSs. Early approaches to the solution were mainly based on PID control theory. With the progression of technology, more advanced techniques have been implemented, such as variable gain scheduling, fuzzy logic control, artificial neural networks, and optimal control [15, 20].\n\nIn this chapter, we propose MPC as reference control technique for the benchmark, and DMPC as its natural extension. The choice of MPC is related to the fact that it provides the optimal control action according to a certain cost function defined by the user, while incorporating constraints on the evolution of the state and control. Nevertheless, the EEA-ENB is designed to be control-independent, and virtually all control techniques can be implemented on it. For a detailed list of control approaches for the LFC problem, we refer to [20].\n"

The benchmark is constituted by 26 control areas due to considerations about the availability and scale of the data about the 31 members of the EEA. The electrical topology of the resulting network is reported in Figure 1, where each country is labeled with the respective ISO code. Positions of the areas in the space are selected according to their geographical centroids, and, on this basis, the lengths of the tie lines are defined using the Euclidean distance as reported in Table 1. In this graph representation, each node is associated with a dynamics incorporating generation, storage, consumption, and interaction behaviors of the considered electrical area and of its neighborhood. In particular, an electrical area is composed of a multiplicity of autonomous subsystems working together to guarantee the satisfaction of the set points assigned by the area-level controller. The aggregation of those subsystems allows one to define an equivalent electrical machine for each area. Specifically, each area may comprehend the following:\n\n\u2022\nA *dispatchable generator* used to model all sources of energy that can be actively\ncontrolled to balance the load. Conventional power sources are hydroelectric turbines, nuclear power plants and gas, oil, or coil turbines. Those sources are associated with an aggregated power generation that we can allocate at each time step according to the production limits of each area.\n\u2022\nNon-dispatchable generation associated with renewable energy production, such\nas wind and solar generation, which have intermittent and stochastic nature. We\nassume that data are available both for the exact value of the produced power and for day-ahead forecasts.\n\u2022\nAn *Energy Storage System* (ESS) used to accumulate and supply energy at the best\nconvenience and according to the control strategy implemented. In general, energy storage systems can be classified into three macro-categories: electrical storage (e.g. ultracapacitors), electrochemical storage (e.g. batteries), and mechanical storage (e.g. water reservoirs). However, this distinction is not considered in the benchmark, but it is suggested as a possible extension. Following the same approach used for dispatchable generation, we consider the aggregated storage and power of all the ESSs in the electrical area.\n\u2022\nA *load demand* for which measurements and day-ahead forecasts are available.\nThose components contribute to the internal load-frequency balance of the electrical area. Moreover, a power exchange among areas is present over the tie lines reported in the electrical topology. This interaction must also be accounted for in the overall power balance.\n"

For each node \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56, we define its neighborhood as N\ud835\udc56 = {\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 \u2208 V | (\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc57) \u2208\nE}, i.e. the set of nodes connected to the node \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56.

We assume $\\delta_{0}=30$[deg], but this depends on the scheduled power exchanges among electrical areas as specified later, with limits $\\delta_{0}\\in(0,90)$[deg]; moreover, the operating frequency of the European power network is $f_{0}=50$[Hz][15]. Regarding the ESS of the $i$-th area, the simplest model capturing the charging and discharging characteristics of a storage system is the linear representation also reported in [22]. Expressions of this model, and alternative formulations of the ESS dynamics, as the PVA description in [18], are discussed in Section 2.4.1. For the tie lines interaction, we also use a linearized equation [15] under the assumption that machine angle deviations are small enough, which will be guaranteed through operating constraints in the control formulation.\n\nTo summarize, the state, input, and external input of the $i$-th area are the vectors:\n\n$$\\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\left[\\Delta\\delta_{i}\\ \\Delta f_{i}\\ e_{i}\\ \\right]^{\\intercal}\\quad\\mathbf{u}_{i}=\\left[\\Delta P_{i}^{\\text{disp}}\\ P_{i}^{\\text{ESS},\\,\\text{c}}\\ P_{i}^{\\text{ESS},\\,\\text{d}}\\ \\right]^{\\intercal}\\quad\\mathbf{w}_{i}=\\left[\\Delta P_{i}^{\\text{load}}\\ \\Delta P_{i}^{\\text{ren}}\\ \\Delta P_{i}^{\\text{iso}}\\ \\right]^{\\intercal},\\tag{1}$$\n\nand their aggregation provides the respective definition of the state, input, and external input vectors for the overall network:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{1}^{\\intercal}\\ \\cdots\\ \\mathbf{x}_{26}^{\\intercal}\\\nAssuming that the discrete-time dynamics obtained through forward Euler discretization has sampling time \ud835\udf0f, the dynamics of the \ud835\udc56-th electrical area has the form:\n\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{i}:\\begin{cases}\\Delta\\delta_{i}\\left(k+1\\right)=\\Delta\\delta_{i}\\left(k\\right)+\\tau2\\pi\\Delta f_{i}\\left(k\\right)\\\\ \\Delta f_{i}\\left(k+1\\right)=\\left(1-\\frac{\\tau}{T_{\\text{P},i}}\\right)\\Delta f_{i}\\left(k\\right)+\\tau\\frac{K_{\\text{P},i}}{T_{\\text{P},i}}\\left(\\Delta P_{i}^{\\text{disp}}\\left(k\\right)-\\Delta P_{i}^{\\text{load}}\\left(k\\right)+\\Delta P_{i}^{\\text{ren}}\\left(k\\right)\\right.\\\\ \\left.-\\Delta P_{i}^{\\text{ide}}\\left(k\\right)-P_{i}^{\\text{ESS},\\,c}\\left(k\\right)+P_{i}^{\\text{ESS},\\,\\text{d}}\\left(k\\right)\\right)\\\\ e_{i}\\left(k+1\\right)=e_{i}\\left(k\\right)+\\tau\\left(\\eta_{i}^{c}P_{i}^{\\text{ESS},\\,c}\\left(k\\right)-\\frac{1}{\\eta_{i}^{d}}P_{i}^{\\text{ESS},\\,\\text{d}}\\left(k\\right)\\right)\\end{cases}\\tag{3}$$\n\n$$\\Delta P_{i}^{\\text{tie}}\\left(k\\right)=\\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{N}_{i}}T_{ij}\\left(\\Delta\\delta_{i}\\left(k\\right)-\\Delta\\delta_{j}\\left(k\\right)\\right),\\tag{4}$$\nwhere \ud835\udc3ep,\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc47p,\ud835\udc56 are respectively the gain and the time constants of the dynamics of the rotating mass; \ud835\udf02c\n\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udf02d\n\ud835\udc56 are charging and discharging rates of the battery with 0 *< \ud835\udf02*c\n\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udf02d\n\ud835\udc56 < 1; and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 [GW/deg] is the gain associated with the tie line (*\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57*), i.e. \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57, which depends on the geographical distance \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 [km] among the electrical areas, and on the gain \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 [km\u00b7GW/deg], which is assumed to be equal to\n1 for all \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 in this chapter.\n"

A simulation of 24 \u00b7 1440 = 34560 steps would use 24 hours of real-world data about load and renewable generation, see Section 3.1 for additional details.\n\nAn aspect not usually considered in LFC systems is the total dispatchable production limit. In this benchmark, using real-world data, we want to constrain the total\n\ndispatchable production to be non-negative, and smaller than the overall capacity of a certain area, i.e. $0\\leq P_{i,0}^{\\rm disp}(k)\\leq P_{i,\\rm max}^{\\rm disp}$.

Additionally, there are ESSs that aggregate the storage capacities of each company. Thus, in each area \ud835\udc56, there is a certain number of dispatchable generators and ESSs. A centralized auction system determines which generation company supplies energy to each area, considering cross-border production, electrical topology, and predefined operational strategies.\n\nWe also highlight the fact that each electrical area can be further subdivided into frontier sectors and a central sector, with tie-lines connecting them. This subdivision of the electrical topology can be used for energy trade modeling. The central sector may account for the generation of critical infrastructures and is connected to all the frontier sectors. Each frontier sector is connected to the frontier sector of a neighboring area and to the central sector of the area it belongs to. This further subdivision of the topology can be used to mitigate the effect of power transmission from adjacent areas, to ensure enhanced stability of the central sector, and to define scheduled power transmissions among neighboring areas.\n\nFuture research should also consider the exploration of different ESS technologies, the challenges related to their implementation, their feasibility, and economic sustainability, all aspects that can contribute to the further refinement of the EEA- ENB.\n"

With this approach, the least expensive network operation strategy can be defined, trading off the lower operational cost of the network with its stability. In this regard, if soft constraints are implemented to limit the frequency deviation, then the total-time-spent and the average-time-spent outside the optimal operation interval of the frequency can also be considered as a performance indicator. Moreover, other control goals can be considered that are more specific to the technological implementation of the network. Those could regard the number of charging and discharging cycles of the batteries, their average charge level, or also the electrical machine angle deviation w.r.t. the most efficient one.

To provide a comparison case for the implementation of distributed control techniques, we have implemented a centralized MPC scheme [7, 18]. Considering the system described in (3), we define at each time step $k$ the following centralized control problem:\n\n$$\\min_{\\mathbf{u}}\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\mathbf{x}^{\\intercal}(j|k)\\mathbf{Rx}(j|k)+\\mathbf{u}^{\\intercal}(j-1|k)\\mathbf{Qu}(j-1|k)$$ $$\\text{s.t.dynamics(3)}\\forall v_{i}\\in\\mathcal{V}\\tag{12}$$ $$\\mathbf{x}(0|k)=\\mathbf{x}(k)\\forall v_{i}\\in\\mathcal{V}$$ $$\\text{constraints(5)}\\forall v_{i}\\in\\mathcal{V}$$ $$\\text{priorated}\\mathbf{u}^{\\intercal}(0|k)\\sim\\mathbf{u}^{\\intercal}(N-1|k)\\intercal,\\ \\mathbf{R}\\ \\text{and}\\ \\mathbf{Q}\\ \\text{are diagonal cost matrices of appropriate distributions,and}\\ N\\ \\text{is the prediction horizon.According to the receding horizon logic of MPC,we apply}\\ \\mathbf{u}(0|k)\\ \\text{to the system,discard the remaining control actions,and therefore.Follow the existence problem,hence efficient algorithms for the problem (12) is a generalization of the optimization problem, the problem can be solved using an active-set or an interior point algorithm.\n\nFor the benchmark, the optimization is performed with Gurbloi Optimizer using the barrier algorithm. The simulation required 206 [1, 15], and 24[1] to be completed using a processor Intel Xeon-2637v3, with a phase clock of 3.5 GHz, and coupled with 128 GB of RAM. The solution of the optimal control problem is the vector of inputs $\\mathbf{u}(t)$, $k=0$, $\\ldots$, $3459$, (the power transmitted over the time times connecting its state), $t$ denotes the electrical areas is reported too, which allows quantifying the power trade necessary across electrical areas for the optimal operation of the network from a centralized and a cooperative perspective. Interactions among electrical areas, or agents in a generalized setting, is indeed one of the critical aspects of a distributed control strategy [8, 16], and often one of the aspects characterizing the control strategy of the definition of the sub-networks in cooperation/competition.\n\nThe evolution of the states resulting from the sequence of inputs obtained through MPC is reported in Figure 6. For the overall power balance of each country, please consult the online repository https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/ariccardi/european-economicarea-electricity-network.\n\nThe evolution of the cost function is presented in Figure 7. Its value is the metric to evaluate distributed control techniques w.r.t. the proposed centralized approach. In the application of distributed control, the performance of the system usually decreases to achieve auxiliary objectives such as improvement in the computation time required to obtain the control action, reduction in the volume of information exchanged across the network (with advantages in the sector of security too), or reliability and redundancy of control in the presence of faults or unforeseen events.\n"

        "content": "\nTo develop a deeper insight into the topics of LFC, MPC, and distributed control some references are reported in the following. In the LFC literature, see also [20], many articles focus on PI control strategies where tuning of the parameters is performed through various optimization techniques [11, 14, 19]. Despite their promising validations and a general increase in performance w.r.t. conventional PI-based LFC, all these strategies still lack the fundamental advantages of model-based control: optimization of performance indices, incorporation of constraints into the control problem, ability to compensate for known external signals, and multi-objective optimization. On the other hand, PI control is easier to implement and has a faster computation speed.\n\nA similar optimization-based tuning approach is used in [6], this time to tune the parameters of an MPC controller.\n\nIn [7] a centralized MPC approach similar to the one proposed in (12) is presented, but in [7], data of the Nordic transmission system is used to build an electricity network model. Power plant models are used to characterize the generation dynamics of each electrical area, but ESSs and renewable generation are not considered. Economic MPC is addressed too in [7] and the results of centralized MPC are compared with a PD controller.\n\nThe use of hydro-pumped storage for LFC of microgrids including renewable generation is explored in [5], where a control architecture based on a decentralized PD controller tuned using a Quasi-Netwon optimization method is implemented.\n\nA characterization of an electricity network using hybrid dynamics is provided in [18]. There, PWA dynamics and binary decision variables are used, leading to a hybrid MPC problem formulated as a Mized Integer Linear Program (MILP), and solved using a branch-and-bound optimization algorithm. This approach is used to model three different aspects: the ESS, the operational mode of the microgrid, and the operational mode of the generation plants.\n\nIn [23] a distributed Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is implemented to tackle the LFC problem. Methods for the distributed computation of the LQR control action are used in [23] to increase the modularity and the scalability of the control architecture. The advantages of this approach rely on the ease of implementation, and on the low computation time needed to compute the control action. The disadvantages are that the applicability of the approach is limited to linear unconstrained control problems.\n\nA way to address Economic MPC can be found in [13]. There, both the LFC\nand economic load dispatch problems for power networks are considered. Those problems are usually approached using hierarchical control structures, where the economic load dispatch is at the upper level, and LFC at a lower level. Instead, in [13] the two problems are considered simultaneously, to improve the economic performance of the systems.\n\nAnother Economic MPC strategy is reported in [10]. There, a multi-objective genetic algorithm predictive control technique is used to simultaneously optimize the conflicting objectives of LFC and security-constrained economic dispatch.\n"

The challenges arising in recent years are often related to the ever-growing use of distributed energy sources which are inertia-less and can affect the frequency of the network. The use of ESSs can mitigate this effect, and we have proposed strategies to model their dynamics, extensions, and future directions for their exploration. Accordingly, future control strategies of electricity networks should account for the presence of distributed energy sources, and the implementation of distributed control strategies for efficient and resilient operation of the network. Those aspects are indeed part of the centralized MPC formulation that we have proposed as a benchmark scheme. An efficient distributed control strategy is expected to perform worse than the centralized one proposed here if only the value of the cost function is considered, but has additional properties such as a reduced computation complexity and computation time, a lower shared volume of information, or enhanced privacy, security and resilience properties.\n"
