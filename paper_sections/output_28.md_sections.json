        "content": "\nWith the rapid growth in the number of Internet-of-Things\n(IoT) devices, the sustainability of equipment and energy supply has become one of the bottlenecks restricting the development of next generation wireless networks [2], [3].\n\nPart of this work was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), Rome, Italy, May 28\u2013 June 1, 2023. [1]\nGuangyu Zhu, Li Guo, Ao Huang and Shibiao Xu are with the Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China, also with the School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China, also with the Engineering Research Center of Ministry of Education for Chain Network Convergence Technology, and also with the National Engineering Research Center for Mobile Internet Security Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China (email:{Zhugy, guoli, huangao, shibiaoxu}@bupt.edu.cn).\n\nXidong Mu is with the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London E1 4NS, U.K. (email:{xidong.mu}@qmul.ac.uk).\n\nTo address this issue, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) as a promising technique has been investigated in [4], [5]. In the SWIPT system, as the carrier of both information and energy, radio-frequency (RF) signals can realize the parallel information exchange and energy supply for IoT devices. In this case, balancing wireless communication and energy transfer becomes an important criterion in the SWIPT system [6]. However, due to the drastically different power sensitivities to receiver and transmission environments, wireless power transfer (WPT) has a significant efficiency gap compared to wireless information transfer (WIT). Especially over a long communication distance, the propagation loss will seriously reduce the efficiency of WPT, which poses a huge challenge for resource allocation to balance the performance of information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs). In this connection, smart antenna technologies are introduced into the SWIPT system to improve user performance [7]. At the same time, however, it should be noted that the increase in active antennas will be accompanied by more energy consumption, higher design complexity, and higher hardware costs. This virtually brings new obstacles to implementation in practice.\n\nRecently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) [8] have emerged as a key rising technology for future communication networks, thanks to their impressive performance in terms of energy efficiency [9]. An RIS is a two-dimensional (2D) surface, comprising large numbers of low-cost and passive meta-materials with tunable reflection properties. Ideally, each reconfigurable element can independently adjust the phase shift and amplitude of the incident signals according to the practical transmission needs, thus facilitating the creation of \"Smart Radio Environments (SREs)\" [10]. Besides, due to the near-passive operation and low hardware footprints, RIS assisted system is more cost-efficient and deployment-flexible compared to conventional active antenna systems. Given these appealing features, the combination of RISs and SWIPT has attracted increasing attention [11].\n\nHowever, limited by their reflection-only nature, RISs can only serve transmitters and receivers located in the same side. This strict geographical restriction severely undermines user fairness and the effectiveness of introducing RISs. To break this limitation and thus achieve *full*-space SREs, a novel concept of RISs, i.e., simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs), has been proposed [12]. Unlike conventional reflecting-only RISs, STAR-RISs can not only reflect but also transmit the incident signals via dynamic configuration adjustment for all users located in both sides of STAR-RISs [13]. Furthermore, STAR-RISs can exploit extra degrees of freedom (DoFs) for system design [14], which may enable more flexible wireless resource allocation to coordinate the performance between WPT and WIT for SWIPT systems. A. Prior Works\n1) *Studies on Resource Allocation for RIS Assisted SWIPT*:\nEnlightened by the enormous potential gains of RISs to transmission efficiency, the new research paradigm of resource allocation for RIS assisted SWIPT has been extensively studied recently in [15]\u2013[23]. In particular, the authors of [15] proposed a single-objective optimization problem (SOOP) for maximizing the weighted sum-power, subject to the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for IUs in RIS aided multiple input single output (MISO) SWIPT systems. On the contrary, the maximization problem for weighted sum-rate, subject to the total harvested power constraints for EUs in RIS assisted multiple input multiple output (MIMO) SWIPT systems was considered in [16]. In other aspects, under the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, the authors of [17] proposed to optimize the joint active and passive beamforming for transmit power minimization in a multiple RISs assisted SWIPT system. The authors further proposed two low-complexity suboptimal algorithms based on maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming techniques to minimize the transmit power at the BS in [18]. Besides, the authors of [19] investigated a similar transmit power minimization problem for a large-scale RIS aided SWIPT system. Considering further the non-linear harvested model, the authors of [20] employed a block coordinate descent (BCD) method to jointly optimize the active beamforming and passive beamforming for minimization of transmit power under the imperfect channel state information\n(CSI) assumption. However, the above studies only focus on either data rate or harvested power. To better portray the conflict between IUs and EUs in SWIPT, the rate-energy trade-offs were investigated in [21]\u2013[23]. Specifically, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) framework was studied by the authors of [21], where energy/information beamforming vectors at the BS and phase shifts at the RIS were jointly optimized to obtain the fundamental trade-off between sumrate and total harvested energy. In [22], the authors jointly optimized waveform, active and passive beamforming by applying a BCD method to achieve a rate-energy region. Besides, the authors of [23] adopted a realistic-based RIS model in a RIS assisted MISO multiuser SWIPT system, where the tradeoff between IUs and EUs was investigated by a penalty-based algorithm.\n\n2) *Studies on STAR-RIS Assisted Communication*: There have been some early efforts to capitalize on the benefits of STAR-RIS deployment in wireless communication systems [12], [24]\u2013[27]. In [12], the authors studied a STAR-RIS assisted two-user downlink MISO system and proposed three different protocols, i.e., energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS), for practical operation. To explore the advantages of each protocol, the authors further study the power consumption minimization problems of unicast and multicast on different protocols. In [24], the authors considered a STAR-RIS aided multi-carrier communication network, where the resource allocation design was achieved for both non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)\nand orthogonal multiple access (OMA) via jointly optimizing the channel assignment, power allocation, and the STAR- RIS configuration. The authors of [25] studied a STAR-RIS aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system and proposed a novel distributionally-robust reinforcement learning algorithm to get a robust design for sum-rate maximization. In [26], resource allocation for STAR-RIS assisted wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) systems was investigated, which illustrated that TS is a more suitable protocol for uplink transmission in MEC. Besides, the STAR-RIS assisted SWIPT was introduced in [27], where the achievable worstcase sum secrecy rate was maximized by applying a convex approximation method.\n\nB. Motivations and Contributions Although the introduction of RISs brings significant performance improvements to SWIPT systems, the *half*-space coverage feature of reflecting-only RISs greatly limits its applicability in practical implementation. Benefiting from the simultaneous transmission and reflection characteristics, the STAR-RIS is envisaged as a potential technology to break this fundamental limitation. By leveraging enhanced DoFs, the STAR-RIS can not only improve SWIPT system performance, but also realize *full*-space coverage for both IUs and EUs.\n\nInspired by this, we propose to introduce the STAR-RIS into the SWIPT system in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, few efforts have been devoted to this topic. Therefore, there are several urgent issues that need to be explored before STAR- RISs can be harmoniously integrated into the existing SWIPT systems.\n\nFirstly, thanks to the *full*-space coverage, the distribution of served users can be more random and dispersed in a STAR- RIS assisted SWIPT system. However, this potential variation may magnify the channel differences among users, thus posing a more intractable resource allocation challenge to balance the performance between IUs and EUs. More importantly, the addition of STAR-RISs will introduce more optimization variables that are not considered in the conventional reflectingonly RIS assisted SWIPT system. Accordingly, the formulated optimization problems will be more intractable, which is beyond the capabilities of the methods applied in [21]\u2013[23]. As such, efficient algorithms need to be developed to resolve the resource allocation problem for STAR-RIS assisted SWIPT systems.\n\nSecondly, most of the aforementioned researches [24]\u2013[26]\nassumed that the perfect CSI of all channels was available to the base station (BS) or access point (AP). However, since there are more channels associated with passive STAR-RISs, more overhead and advanced channel estimation algorithms than conventional reflecting-only RISs need to be invested in the acquisition of accurate CSI. This is a very challenging but still infancy task [28]. Therefore, in order to reduce the impact of channel uncertainty on system performance in practical scenarios, it is necessary to investigate a robust design to deal with channel estimation errors.\n\nThirdly, the authors of [12] proposed three different operating protocols for STAR-RIS and revealed their respective benefits for different communication scenarios and requirements.\n\nInterestingly, EUs and IUs have different power sensitivities to signal beams, transmission environments, and inter-user interference in the SWIPT system. Bearing all this in mind, a new but crucial question, i.e., Which protocol is more suitable for the SWIPT system? is naturally raised. Note that the authors of [27] only considered the ES protocol for STAR-RIS assisted SWIPT and did not answer this question, which is still an open issue and needs to be answered.\n\nMotivated by these observations, we investigate the robust resource allocation for a STAR-RIS assisted SWIPT system based on the imperfect CSI assumption. In particular, two operating protocols, i.e., ES and TS, are considered. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n- We propose a STAR-RIS assisted SWIPT system, where\nan STAR-RIS is deployed to assist a multi-antenna AP\nto simultaneously transmit information and power to two types of single-antenna users, i.e., IUs and EUs. From a practical perspective, we consider the imperfect CSI for all channels. In order to investigate the fundamental tradeoff between IUs and EUs, we formulate MOOPs for both ES and TS to simultaneously maximize the minimum data rate for IUs and the minimum harvested power among EUs.\n- For ES, we first leverage the \u01eb-constraint method to\ntransform the resulting MOOP into a more tractable SOOP. Then, we adopt the general S-procedure to approximate the semi-infinite inequality constraints for any\ngiven \u01eb. Finally, to solve the reformulated highly-coupled\nnon-convex SOOP, we develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) framework by solving the active AP beamforming and passive STAR-RIS beamforming in an iterative manner. In particular, a penalty-based method is leveraged to relax the rank-one constraint for STAR- RIS beamforming optimization. Besides, to ensure the\nfeasibility of \u01eb-constraint method, we apply bisection\nsearch to obtain the performance upper boundary of IUs\nand determine the reasonable range for \u01eb.\n- For TS, we still apply the \u01eb-constraint method and general\nS-procedure to transform the MOOP. Subsequently, we extend the proposed algorithm for ES into a two-layer optimization algorithm to solve the reformulated SOOP. In the outer-layer iteration, we determine the optimal time allocation via one-dimensional search. While for the inner-layer, we update the remaining variables by utilizing the AO-based algorithm in each iteration.\n- Our numerical results depict that 1) deploying STAR-\nRISs can achieve a significant rate-energy region gain to conventional RISs in SWIPT systems, especially in terms of harvested power; 2) ES is more attractive for improving user fairness when focusing only on IUs or EUs, while TS is superior at balancing the performance between IUs and EUs. More importantly, TS can provide a more robust design under the imperfect CSI; 3) the deployment strategy of having all EUs on the same side of the STAR-RIS while all IUs on the other side yields higher performance gains, but also results in more\nimplementation difficulties.\n"

For simplification, we assume the information beam and energy beam are independent.

Therefore, the simple far-field channel model is a safe approximation.\n\n2In this paper, to determine the maximum performance gain, we investigate the beamforming design under the assumption of the phase shift coefficients for transmission and reflection can be adjusted independently. However, the proposed schemes can also be applied to the case where the phase shifts are coupled at the STAR-RIS with proper modifications [30].\n\n1) ES: When the ES protocol is employed, the received signal at IU i is given by\n\n$$y_{i}^{I}=\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{H}\\mathbf{\\Theta}_{s_{i}}^{\\text{ES}}\\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{x}+n_{i},\\forall i\\in\\mathcal{K}\\mathcal{I},\\tag{3}$$\nwhere si \u2208 {t, r} indicates the region where IU i is located, and si = t if the user is located in T region, otherwise, si = r.\n\nni \u223c CN(0, \u03c32) denotes the additive white Guassion noise at IU i. Since the energy beam is a Gaussian pseudo-random sequence and carries no information, we assume it can be decoded by the receiving IU and removed from the received signal, as properly adopted in [31]. Therefore, the SINR of IU\ni is given as\n\nSINRi = | \ufffd uES si \ufffdH Hiwi|2 \ufffd k\u2208KI,k\u0338=i | \ufffd uES si \ufffdH Hiwk|2 + \u03c32 , (4)\n\nwhere uES\n       si\n          = [\n              \ufffd\n\n\u03b2si\n 1 ej\u03b8\n    si\n    1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n          \ufffd\n\n                          \u03b2si\n                           Mej\u03b8\n                              si\n                              M ]H, si \u2208 {t, r},\nHi = diag(hi)G denotes as the cascaded channel from the\nAP to IU i.\n\n  On the other hand, due to the characteristics of energy\nbroadcasting, all information and energy beams are desirable\nfor each EU. At this point, the energy harvesting (EH) of EUs\nis virtually unaffected by interference and noise [31].

For ease of analysis, we set \u03b7 = 1 in the subsequent context.\n\n2) TS: When the TS protocol is employed, the AP can communicate adaptively with users located in T and R regions in different time slots, so the interference among IUs from different regions can be ignored. For ease of identification and description, we re-denote ws i and vs j, s \u2208 {t, r} as the beamforming for IU i and EU j, respectively. Note that wr i = 0 if IU i is located in the T region, and wt i = 0 if IU i is located in the R region. The same guidelines also apply to vs j for EU j. In this way, the SINR at IU i and the harvested power of EU j are rewritten as (6a) and (6b), respectively, which is shown at the top of the next page, where uTS\ns = [ej\u03b8s\n1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ej\u03b8s M ]H, s \u2208 {t, r}.\n\n3Although the non-linear EH model can capture the saturation effect more precisely for a single EH circuit [32], multi-parallel EH circuits effectively rectify the non-linear effect and cause a large linear conversion region [33]. Inspired by this, we adopt the linear EH model to investigate the fundamental design insights for STAR-RIS assisted SWIPT systems. Besides, by replacing the EH model with the non-linear model proposed in [19] and [34], our optimization framework is applicable, but some modifications still need to be investigated, which are our future focus topics.\n\n4In this paper, we use the unit time of 1 second to measure system performance.

CSI Error Model Due to the passive property and channel complexity of the STAR-RIS, it is challenging to acquire the accurate CSI of the links associated with the STAR-RIS. To consider this effect on resource allocation design for the proposed system, we adopt a practical bounded CSI error model, where all possible channel errors are modeled by a bounded set [36], [37]5. To be more specific, we directly rewrite the cascaded channels from the AP to IUs/EUs via the STAR-RIS with the following models:\n\n$$\\mathbf{H}_{i}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{H}}_{i}+\\triangle\\mathbf{H}_{i},\\forall i\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{I}},\\tag{7}$$ $$\\mathcal{H}_{i}\\triangleq\\{\\triangle\\mathbf{H}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{M\\times N}:\\|\\triangle\\mathbf{H}_{i}\\|_{F}\\leq\\varepsilon_{i}\\},$$ (8) $$\\mathbf{G}_{j}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{G}}_{j}+\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j},\\forall j\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{E}},$$ (9) $$\\mathcal{G}_{j}\\triangleq\\{\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{M\\times N}:\\|\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j}\\|_{F}\\leq\\mu_{j}\\},\\tag{10}$$\n\nwhere $\\widehat{\\mathbf{H}}_{i},\\forall i\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{I}}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbf{G}}_{j},\\forall j\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{E}}$ are estimations of the corresponding channel $\\mathbf{H}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{G}_{j}$, respectively[6]$\\triangle\\mathbf{H}_{i}$ and $\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j}$ denote the channel estimation errors. Sets $\\mathcal{H}_{i}$ and $\\mathcal{G}_{j}$ collect all possible channel estimation errors, $\\varepsilon_{i}$ and $\\mu_{j}$ denote the maximum threshold for the norms of the CSI estimation error vectors $\\triangle\\mathbf{H}_{i}$ and $\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j}$, respectively.\n\nD. Problem Formulation In this paper, our goal is to simultaneously maximize the minimum data rate for IUs and harvested power for EUs to guarantee fairness among all users under imperfect CSI. For the conflict between two objectives, we apply a MOOP framework to elaborately design the robust resource allocation. More specifically, we consider the following MOOP formulations based on two different protocols for STAR-RIS operation, i.e., ES and TS.\n\n1) MOOP Formulation for ES: To begin with, we only focus on maximizing the minimum harvested power among EUs, by jointly optimizing the active beamforming {wi}, {vj} and passive configuration {uES\ns }. Under imperfect CSI, the robust design problem is formulated as\n\n$$\\max_{\\{\\mathbf{w}_{i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{u}_{s}^{\\mathrm{E}}\\}}\\min_{j}\\ P_{j}$$ s.t. $$\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{I}}}\\|\\mathbf{w}_{i}\\|^{2}+\\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{E}}}\\|\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\|^{2}\\leq P_{\\max},\\tag{11a}$$ $$\\theta_{m}^{s}\\in[0,2\\pi),\\forall m\\in\\mathcal{M},s\\in\\{t,r\\},\\tag{11b}$$ $\\begin{cases}r,\\text{if IU}i\\text{located in R region,}\\\\ t,\\text{if IU}i\\text{located in T region.}\\end{cases}$ (6a) $\\begin{cases}r,\\text{if EU}j\\text{located in R region,}\\\\ t,\\text{if EU}j\\text{located in T region.}\\end{cases}$ (6b) $\\begin{cases}t,\\text{if EU}j\\text{located in T region.}\\end{cases}$ (6c) $\\begin{cases}\\beta^{t}_{m},\\beta^{r}_{m}\\in[0,1],\\ \\beta^{t}_{m}+\\beta^{r}_{m}=1,\\forall m\\in\\mathcal{M}.\\end{cases}$ (11c)\nwhere constraint (11a) represents the total transmit power budget at the AP. (11b) and (11c) are the constraints on phase shift and amplitude for STAR-RIS elements, respectively. Next, with imposing the same constraints, the minimum data rate maximization problem for IUs is formulated as\n\n$\\max\\limits_{\\{\\mathbf{w}_{i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{u}_{s}^{\\mathrm{BS}}\\}}\\min\\limits_{i}\\log_{2}(1+\\mathrm{SINR}_{i})$\n\ns.t. (11a) - (11c). (12a)\nSubsequently, the MOOP for ES based on problems (11) and (12) is formulated in the following:\n\n* $\\max\\limits_{\\{\\mathbf{w}_{i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{u}_{s}^{\\mathrm{BS}}\\}}\\min\\limits_{j}\\ P_{j}$\n* $\\max\\limits_{\\{\\mathbf{w}_{i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{u}_{s}^{\\mathrm{BS}}\\}}\\min\\limits_{i}\\ \\log_{2}(1+\\mathrm{SINR}_{i})$ (13a) s.t. (11a) - (11c). (13b)\n2) MOOP Formulation for TS: Unlike in ES, where all users can access the entire communication time, TS introduces time allocation variables \u03bbr and \u03bbt for different regional users. The STAR-RIS will only provide services to users located in the corresponding region during the allocated time. Therefore, the MOOP framework for TS is formulated as\n\n* $\\max\\limits_{\\{\\mathbf{w}_{i}^{s}\\},\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}^{s}\\},\\{\\mathbf{u}_{i}^{s}\\}}\\min\\limits_{i}\\ \\lambda_{s}P_{j}^{s}$\n* $\\max\\limits_{\\{\\mathbf{w}_{i}^{s}\\},\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}^{s}\\},\\{\\mathbf{u}_{i}^{s}\\}}\\min\\limits_{j}\\ \\lambda_{s}\\log_{2}(1+\\text{SINR}_{i}^{s})$\n* $\\lambda_{r}\\left(\\sum\\limits_{i\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{I}}}\\|\\mathbf{w}_{i}^{r}\\|^{2}+\\sum\\limits_{j\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{E}}}\\|\\mathbf{v}_{j}^{r}\\|^{2}\\right)$ $$+\\lambda_{t}\\left(\\sum\\limits_{i\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{I}}}\\|\\mathbf{w}_{i}^{t}\\|^{2}+\\sum\\limits_{j\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{E}}}\\|\\mathbf{v}_{j}^{t}\\|^{2}\\right)\\leq P_{\\max},$$ (14a) $$\\theta_{m}^{s}\\in[0,2\\pi),\\forall m\\in\\mathcal{M},s\\in\\{t,r\\},$$ (14b) $$\\lambda_{r},\\lambda_{t}\\in[0,1],\\ \\lambda_{r}+\\lambda_{t}=1.$$ (14c)\nSimilar to problem (13), optimization objectives (Q3) and (Q4) denote the minimum harvested power and minimum data rate maximization, respectively. (14a) and (14b) are the constraints of the power budget at AP and the phase shift of the STAR- RIS, respectively. Besides, (14c) is a new constraint on time allocation introduced by the TS protocol.\n\nObserve that both (13) and (14) are tricky problems that are challenging to solve directly. The main causes are as follows, briefly stated: 1) Since the two optimization objective functions of each problem are conflicting, there is no available resource allocation strategy to maximize the two goals simultaneously; 2) all optimization variables in the objective functions are closely coupled, which leads to the highly non-convexity for optimization problems; and 3) owing to the uncertainty of CSI, all objective functions have infinite possibilities, which are infeasible to handle in polynomial time. To sum up, the combination of the above factors makes it impossible to find an existing algorithm that can be directly applied to our formulated MOOPs. To circumvent this issue, we will explore efficient algorithms to solve the robust resource allocation problems (13) and (14) in the next.\n"

        "content": "\nA. Proposed Solution for ES\nTo start with, we investigate the robust resource allocation problem for ES by jointly optimizing the active beamforming\n(i.e., {wi}and {vj}) at the AP and passive beamforming (i.e.,\n{uES\ns }) of the STAR-RIS. Inspired by the fact that the \u01eb-\nconstraint method can generate the whole Pareto frontier of the two conflict objective values by setting different \u01eb [40], we first adopt the \u01eb-constraint method [41], which transforms\n(Q2) into a constraint associated with \u01eb and specifies (Q1) as the unique objective function. Accordingly, the original MOOP is reduced to the form of SOOP as follows:\n\n$$\\max_{\\{\\mathbf{w}_{i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{u}_{s}^{\\mathrm{BS}}\\}}\\min\\{P_{j}|j\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{E}}\\}$$ s.t. $$\\log_{2}\\left(1+\\frac{|\\left(\\mathbf{u}_{s_{i}}^{\\mathrm{ES}}\\right)^{H}\\mathbf{H}_{i}\\mathbf{w}_{i}|^{2}}{\\sum_{k\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{I},k\\neq i}}|\\left(\\mathbf{u}_{s_{i}}^{\\mathrm{ES}}\\right)^{H}\\mathbf{H}_{i}\\mathbf{w}_{k}|^{2}+\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\\geq\\epsilon,$$ $$\\forall i\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{I}},s_{i}\\in\\{t,r\\},\\tag{15a}$$ $$(11a)-(11c),\\tag{15b}$$\nwhere constraint (15a) indicates the minimum data rate requirements for IUs. It can be shown that the constraint will get equality at the optimal solution to problem (15). Otherwise, more communication resources can be shifted from IUs to EUs to improve the objective function while ensuring that (15a) holds. Therefore, different trade-offs between IUs and EUs will result from different \u01eb values. By solving a series of SOOPs corresponding to the ergodic value of \u01eb, the entire Pareto boundary of the trade-off region for original MOOP can be properly characterized.\n\nHowever, the high coupling of variables and the infinite possibility of channel errors remain the main obstacles to solving SOOP (15). Let us define Wi \u225c wiwH\ni , \u2200i \u2208 KI, Vj \u225c vjvH\nj , \u2200j \u2208 KE as well as UES\ns\n\u225c uES\ns\n\ufffd\nuES\ns\n\ufffdH.\n\nThen, by introducing an auxiliary variable \u03b7, which satisfies Pj \u2265 \u03b7, \u2200j \u2208 KE, the considered problem (15) can be transformed into the following equivalent rank-constrained SDP:\n\n$$\\operatorname*{max}_{\\{\\mathbf{W}_{i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{V}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{U}_{i}^{\\mathrm{ess}}\\},\\eta}\\eta$$ \u2265 \u03b7, s.t.

(18)\nDue to the uncertainty of Hi and Gj, there are an infinite number of such constraints (17) and (18) in problem (16). Next, we will draw on the following lemma to deal with this issue.\n\nLemma 1. (General S-Procedure [42]): Define the quadratic functions of the variable x \u2208 CN\u00d71:\nfi(x) = xHAix + 2Re{xHbi} + ci, \u2200i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , K,\n\u2ab0 0.\n\n\u2212\n\n\ufffd\n Ai\n    bi\nbH\n i\n    ci\n\n\ufffd\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}_{i}$ is the complex symmetric matrix, i.e., $\\mathbf{A}_{i}=\\mathbf{A}_{i}^{H}$.

With\nGj = \ufffdGj + \u25b3Gj, (17) can be converted to the following\nequivalent form:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\mbox{vec}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{G}}_{j}+\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j})^{H}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{1}\\otimes\\mathbf{U}_{s_{j}}^{\\rm ES}\\right)\\mbox{vec}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{G}}_{j}+\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j})-\\eta\\\\ =\\mbox{vec}(\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j})^{H}\\mbox{\\bf Avec}(\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j})+2\\mbox{\\bf Re}\\{\\mbox{vec}(\\triangle\\mathbf{G}_{j})^{H}\\mathbf{b}\\}+c\\geq0,\\end{array}\\tag{19}$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{S}_{1}\\otimes\\mathbf{U}_{s_{j}}^{\\rm ES}$, $\\mathbf{b}=\\mbox{\\bf Avec}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{G}}_{j})$, $c=\\mbox{vec}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{G}}_{j})^{H}\\mathbf{b}-$\n\u03b7.

Through these transformations above, problem (16) is recasted as\n\n$$\\max_{\\{\\lambda_{1,j}\\},\\{\\lambda_{2,i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{W}_{i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{V}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\text{ES}}\\},\\eta}\\eta$$ s.t. $$(21),(22),(16c)-(16h).\\tag{23a}$$\nHowever, the optimization variables are still coupled in (21)\nand (22), and it is challenging to optimize them simultaneously. To solve this issue, the AO method is applied to decompose problem (23) into two subproblems, i.e., active beamforming design and passive beamforming design, which can be alternatively optimized.\n\n1) Active Beamforming Design: Here, we exclusively concentrate on active beamforming design. For given {UES\ns }, original problem (23) is simplified to\n\n$\\{\\lambda_{1,j}\\},\\{\\lambda_{2,i}\\},\\{\\Psi_{i}\\},\\{\\Psi_{j}\\},\\eta$\n\ns.t. (21), (22), (16c) - (16e). (24a)\nAs can be observed, the non-convexity of rank-one constraints\n(16d) and (16e) restricts the solution of the new problem (24). To handle it, we employ semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and ignore the constraints (16d) and (16e) directly according to the following theorem.\n\nProof. Please refer to the Appendix.\n\nTheorem 1. The optimal solutions for the relaxed version\nof problem (24), i.e., without considering rank-one con-\nstraints, always satisfy Rank (W\u2217\n                           i )\n                               =\n                                  1, \u2200i \u2208\n                                          KI and\n\ufffd\n  j\u2208KE Rank\n           \ufffd\n            V\u2217\n             j\n              \ufffd\n                \u2264 1 for feasible Pmax > 0 and \u01eb > 0.\n\n  As a result, the relaxed problem (24) is a standard SDP, and\ncan be efficiently solved via existing convex solvers such as\nCVX [43].\n\n2) Passive Beamforming Design: In this subproblem, we optimize the passive beamforming with fixed {Wi} and {Vj}.\n\nThis subproblem is reduced to\n\n$\\begin{array}{c}\\max\\\\ \\{\\lambda_{1,i}\\},\\{\\lambda_{2,i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\rm ES}\\},\\eta\\\\ \\mbox{s.t.}\\ \\ (21),(22),(16\\mbox{f})-(16\\mbox{h}).\\end{array}$ (25a)\nNote that the difficulty in the design of STAR-RIS coefficients stems from the rank-one constraint (16f). Different from the relaxation of problem (24), we first rewrite this constraint as an equivalent form [44]:\n\n$$\\text{Rank}(\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\text{ES}})=1\\Leftrightarrow\\|\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\text{ES}}\\|_{*}-\\|\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\text{ES}}\\|_{2}=0,\\forall s\\in\\{t,r\\},\\tag{26}$$\nwhere \u2225UES\ns \u2225\u2217 = \ufffd\n\nwhere $||\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}}||_{*}=\\sum_{i}\\sigma_{i}(\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}})$ and $||\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}}||_{2}=\\sigma_{1}(\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}})$ denote the nuclear norm and spectral norm of $\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}}$, respectively, and $\\sigma_{i}$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of $\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}}$. Then, the penalty method [45] is leveraged, where we convert the constraint (16f) into a non-negative penalty function term appended to the objective function as follows:\n\n$$\\max_{\\{\\lambda_{1,j}\\},\\{\\lambda_{2,i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}}\\},\\eta}\\eta-\\xi\\sum_{s\\in\\{t,r\\}}\\left(\\|\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}}\\|_{*}-\\|\\mathbf{U}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}}\\|_{2}\\right)$$ s.t. $$(21),(22),(16g),(16h),\\tag{27a}$$\nwhere \u03be > 0 is the penalty factor. Driven by the optimization goal, the value of the penalty term will decrease with the increase of \u03be, and when \u03be \u2192 +\u221e, the penalty term gradually converges to 0. At this point, the optimal solution UES\ns of problem (27) always satisfies the equality constraint (16f).\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the initial value of \u03be has a significant impact on the effect of the algorithm. At the start of the iteration, if \u03be is too large, the focus of optimization will shift from the original function \u03b7 to the penalty item, which violates our intention. Hence, we need to initialize \u03be\nwith a small value, and then gradually increase it until the convergence criterion of the rank-one constraint is met:\n\n$$\\max\\{\\|{\\bf U}_{s}^{\\rm ES}\\|_{*}-\\|{\\bf U}_{s}^{\\rm ES}\\|_{2},s\\in\\{t,r\\}\\}\\leq\\epsilon_{1},\\tag{28}$$\nwhere \u01eb1 is a predefined maximum violation of the equality constraint.\n\nNevertheless, the non-convexity of the penalty term makes the reformulated problem (27) still difficult to solve.

And the penalty-based algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1.\n\nTo this end, the original problem (23) with highly coupled variables was decomposed into two subproblems, i.e., problems (24) and (30), which are solved in an iterative manner, according to the AO method. Wherein, the non-convexity for active beamforming design is relaxed according to Theorem\n1, while the rank-one constraint in STAR-RIS beamforming is solved by employing penalty-based Algorithm 1. On the one hand, the objective function of problem (30) will gradually converge with the increase of the penalty factor in each passive beamforming design [44]. On the other hand, the AO iteration algorithm is guaranteed to converge, and the relevant proofs can be found in the literature [17]. Therefore, our proposed algorithm for problem (23) will eventually converge to a stationary point. The specific details of the developed algorithm are presented in Algorithm 2.\n\nIn addition, there is a straightforward observation that the obtained solution to problem (23) is generally sensitive to the value of \u01eb. In order to ensure the feasibility of problem (23), the value of \u01eb should be in a reasonable range [0, Rmax]. Rmax is the maximum achievable data rate for this system, and might be attained by resolving the subsequent optimization problem:\n\n$$\\max_{\\{\\mathbf{w}_{i}\\},\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{u}_{s}^{\\mathrm{ES}}\\},\\gamma}\\gamma$$ s.t. $$\\frac{|\\left(\\mathbf{u}_{s_{i}}^{\\mathrm{ES}}\\right)^{H}\\mathbf{H}_{i}\\mathbf{w}_{i}|^{2}}{\\sum_{k\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{I}},k\\neq i}|\\left(\\mathbf{u}_{s_{i}}^{\\mathrm{ES}}\\right)^{H}\\mathbf{H}_{i}\\mathbf{w}_{k}|^{2}+\\sigma^{2}}\\geq\\gamma,$$ $$\\forall i\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{I}},s_{i}\\in\\{t,r\\},\\tag{31a}$$ $$(11\\mathrm{a})-(11\\mathrm{c}).\\tag{31b}$$\n"

Therefore, the main difficulty in\nsolving problem (35) falls in the determination of the optimal\n\ntime allocation policy. To overcome this issue, a two-layer algorithm is proposed. In the outer layer, the one-dimensional search is used to obtain the optimal time allocation {\u03bb\u2217\nt , \u03bb\u2217\nr}.\n\nWhile the remaining variables can be optimized by the innerlayer iteration with fixed {\u03bb\u2217\nt , \u03bb\u2217\nr}.\n\nLikewise, in order to ensure the feasibility of the problem\n(35), we explore the maximum value of \u01eb allowed for TS\nby invoking the similar method for ES. Specially, we first introduce a new variable \u03b30 that satisfies \u03bbs log2(1+SINRs i) \u2265\n\u03b30, s \u2208 {t, r} and build a new function as (36), which is shown at the top of the next page.

(37a)\n\n(14a) - (14c). (37b)\nIt is obvious that the problem (37) can be solved similarly to how the problem (35) was previously presented. Accordingly, we can update the value of \u03b30 with bisection criteria until (34)\nis satisfied. As a result, by traversing the value of \u01eb in this determined feasible region and solving the related SOOP, we can get a proper rate-energy trade-off region for TS. Since it is similar to Algorithm 3, the specific details of the algorithm proposed for TS are omitted here.\n"

For fairness in comparison, each conventional RIS consists of M/2 elements, and the coefficient matrices are regarded as \u03b2t = [11\u00d7M/2, 01\u00d7M/2]T for transmittingonly RIS and \u03b2r = [01\u00d7M/2, 11\u00d7M/2]T for reflecting-only RIS. It is worth noting that the resulting optimization problems for baseline schemes can also be solved directly by applying Algorithm 2. It is important to emphasize that the following results shown (i.e., Figs. 3-9) are obtained by averaging over 50 channel realizations unless otherwise specified. B. Convergence of Algorithm 2\nIn Fig. 3, we show the convergence behavior of the proposed Algorithm 2 for STAR-RIS ES and reflecting-only RIS with different STAR-RIS elements M. Specially, we set N = 4,\n\u03c1H = \u03c1G = 0.01 and \u01eb = 0. The results obtained for one random channel realization depict that the max-min harvested power of EUs increases quickly as the number of iterations increases, and finally converges to a value within 6 iterations for M = 8 and M = 16.

The results depict that the rate-energy region for all schemes expands with the number of antennas due to the active beamforming gain. In addition, regions obtained by the proposed scheme are larger than those obtained with reflecting-only RISs and conventional RISs because the former can take advantage of more DoFs. Further, regarding the performance for two protocols of STAR-RISs, ES is able to achieve both higher upper boundaries, i.e., Rmax and Emax, for IUs and EUs, respectively. However, TS can ensure better a performance balance for all users. This can be explained as follows. Compared to TS, ES accommodates all users to utilize the entire time resource for communication or charging, thus enabling a better upper bound on data rate/harvested power when only focusing on IUs or EUs. However, the time allocation for TS allows the AP and the STAR-RIS to serve users in only one region during each allocated time period, which reduces competition for communication resources between IUs and EUs as well as interference among IUs. As a result, the decline of harvested power is more moderate as the data rate increases, leading to a better balance between IUs and EUs.\n\nIn Fig. 4(b), we further explore the max-min harvested power for EUs versus the number of AP antennas. We set the max-min data rate of IUs to be Rmin = 4 bit/s/hz, M = 16, and \u03c1G = \u03c1H = \u03c1 = 0.01. As depicted in Fig. 4(b), the maxmin harvested power for all schemes increases with the number of AP antennas, and STAR-RISs outperform reflecting-RISs and conventional RISs. This is expected because, compared with reflecting-RIS, although adopting STAR-RIS leads to energy leakage or time loss for each user, the flexible deployment of STAR-RIS can provide better channel conditions, which can make up for the loss of communication resources. More importantly, the enhanced DoFs exploited by STAR-RISs can further boost desired signals and suppress unwanted ones, thereby achieving a significant performance improvement.\n"

Firstly, it is seen that the rate-energy region grows for all schemes as M increases, and the performance gap between the proposed design and the baseline schemes becomes more pronounced. This is because more elements lead to higher transmission/reflection beamforming gains and DoFs benefits. Secondly, the power gain for EUs is more significant than the rate gain for IUs. This can be explained by citing the following causes. The calculation of the information rate requires a logarithmic operation, which weakens the gain brought by RISs to received SINR. Whereas, the calculation of harvested power does not involve logarithmic operations, thus resulting in the differences in growth rates. Similar reasons can be used to explain the higher performance gains for EUs than IUs via the introduction of STAR-RISs.\n\nIn Fig. 5(b), we further investigate the max-min harvested power for EUs versus the number of STAR-RIS elements under the max-min data rate Rmin = 4 bit/s/hz. We set N = 4, and \u03c1G = \u03c1H = 0.01. As can be observed, the max-min harvested power for all schemes increases with the STAR-RIS elements. Particularly, STAR-RISs rise noticeably faster than reflecting-RISs and conventional RISs. This is because the extra DoFs for STAR-RISs can extend the passive beamforming gains by more elements. Besides, the gap between TS and ES\nincreases as M increases. This is made possible by the fact that interference-free communication for TS can make up for the inefficient use of the communication time when the M is large.\n"

Simulation results depict that the performance region for all schemes decreases as \u03c1 increases, and the performance decline of our proposed scheme is more pronounced than the baseline schemes employing reflecting-only RISs and conventional RISs. This can be understood by pointing out that increasing design DoFs leads to a larger channel estimation error and reduces the robustness of user performance. In particular, the channel error has a greater impact on the IUs than the EUs for STAR-RISs working in ES mode and conventional RISs. This is because, the uncertainty of the channel can not only diminish the desired signal received by IUs like EUs, but also enhance the interference from other IUs. However, TS is able to minimize the interference between IUs, which leads to more robustness for IUs under imperfect CSI.\n\nFig. 6(b) further investigates the max-min harvested power versus the cascaded channel uncertainty levels under the maxmin data rate Rmin = 4 bit/s/hz. We set M = 16, N = 4, affect IUs more than EUs, and as \u03c1 increases to also satisfy Rmin = 4 bit/s/hz, more communication resources need to be allocated to IUs, thus significantly weakening the performance of EUs.

        "content": "\nIn Fig. 7, we investigate the impact of STAR-RISs deployment strategies on achievable rate-energy region. In addition to the deployment strategy of the basic scenario described above, here we consider a special deployment strategy of STAR-RISs that makes all IUs and EUs located in the T and R regions, respectively. For fairness of comparison, we set M = 16, N = 4 and \u03c1G = \u03c1H = 0.01. As can be seen, the special deployment strategy outperforms basic deployment strategy for all schemes. Following are some explanations for the causes of this. Considering the STAR-RISs ES protocol and conventional RISs, the phase shift design of RISs for the basic deployment strategy needs to balance the requirements of both IU and EU in the same region, but also to suppress the interference from IU located in another region, which cuts the passive beamforming gains. But the special deployment strategy only considers competition between users located in the same region for resource allocation, which reduces the energy leakage for each IU or EU and enhances resource dedication. While for the STAR-RISs TS protocol, more time resources can be allocated for all IUs and EUs by employing the special deployment strategy, which further compensates for the lack of time available in the basic deployment strategy. Therefore, the special deployment strategy results in a better rate-energy region. However, the stringent requirements for user distribution entail higher implementation difficulties, especially as the number of users grows.\n\nIn Fig. 8, we study the achievable rate-energy region versus different filters at the HAP. Here, the zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming scheme is introduced as a comparison for our proposed beamforming scheme under both the ES and TS\nprotocols. In the basic scenario, we set N = 4, M = 16, and\n\u03c1G = \u03c1H = 0.01. The Fig. 8 depicts that our proposed scheme outperforms the ZF beamforming scheme for both ES and TS. Moreover, the performance improvement for EUs is greater than that for IUs. The reasons can be explained as follows. When the number of antennas is sufficient, ZF beamforming can fully suppress the interference between users. However, due to stringent interference elimination requirements, ZF beamforming also inevitably reduces the flexibility of communication resource allocation, which results in poorer performance gains for IUs than our proposed beamforming scheme. While for EUs, unlike ZF's obsession with eliminating all interference, our proposed scheme fully exploits the potential of constructive interference and suppresses destructive interference for each EU. As a result, our scheme achieve a more significant performance gain in EUs than ZF beamforming. On the other hand, since the TS protocol has effectively attenuated inter-user interference, there is a smaller performance gap between our proposed scheme and ZF beamforming compared to ES.\n"

Compared to the basic setup, two new scenarios are considered with 4 EUs, 2 IUs and 2 IUs, 4\nEUs, respectively, where we set M\n= 16, N = 4 and\n\u03c1G = \u03c1H = 0.01. For ease of exploration, we assume all IUs and EUs are uniformly located in the T and R regions. As clearly shown in Fig. 9, as the number of users increases, the obtained rate-energy region becomes smaller. This is a result of that when a new user accesses the system, in order to ensure fairness among users, the communication resources allocated to each user will decrease. Especially, increasing the number of IUs, the system performance degrades more significantly, as expected. This is because IUs are not only limited by their individual QoS requirements, but can also cause significant inter-user interference to other IUs. This fact also leads to TS\noutperforming ES when the number of IUs is large. Because TS provides a good suppression on the inter-user interference, which can impair the impact of lost time resources and thus contribute to achieving higher performance gains.\n"

Based on the assumption of imperfect CSI, two MOOP frameworks for different operating protocols were deployed to study the fundamental trade-off between the max-min data rate and harvested power. For each protocol, the MOOP was first converted into a SOOP by applying the \u01eb-constraint method, and then an AO-based algorithm was proposed to explore the robust resource allocation design. Numerical results unveiled that STAR-RISs can greatly outperform conventional reflectingonly RISs in terms of system performance, especially for EUs. Also, the ES and TS protocols of STAR-RISs can enhance the SWIPT system from different perspectives. Imagine that, combined with implementation difficulties, these insights will offer helpful suggestions for the resource allocation design of STAR-RIS aided SWIPT systems in practical scenarios.\n"
