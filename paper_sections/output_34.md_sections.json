        "content": "\nInternational trade can be a profitable business for agri-food communities. However, access to international markets can be costly and thus unattainable for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This problem is exacerbated under trade policies which require minimum quantity commitments (MQCs) on export volumes, e.g., licensing tariff rate quota (TRQ) mechanisms. We show how cooperative exporting among agri-food SMEs can tackle the barriers posed by the MQCs, and give market access to a broader range of SMEs. We formulate a class of cooperative games associated with these situations and find a gain-sharing mechanism that result in allocations in their corresponding cores. Thus, grand coalitions of cooperative exporting SMEs can form in stable manners. This allocation rule shares the export surplus only among the \"essential\" SME exporters, that is, the players who are sufficiently cost efficient. Thus, less cost efficient \"complimentary\" SMEs whose capacities are needed to maintain MQCs receive no benefit from collaborative exporting and their participation have to be altruistic. We propose two modifications to our original allocation rule to share a portion of export surplus among the complementary SMEs through taxing the essential SMEs: the first through egalitarian, and the second through revenue-based rates. We compare the performance of these allocations with the numerical examples and discuss their practical implications.\n\nKEYWORDS: Production, Manufacturing, Transportation and Logistics, Game Theory, International Trade, Cooperative Export\n"

        "content": "\nTrade brings about vital business opportunities for businesses in the food supply chain, while also helping to diminish global food insecurity and expanding consumer choices for various goods. The trade in agricultural and food products has experienced substantial growth in the past twenty years, averaging an annual increase of nearly 7% in real terms from 2001 to 2019. Agri-food trade is not only on the rise but is also progressively evolving into a truly global phenomenon (OECD, 2023). Agri-food trade is also heavily reliant on logistics to run the supply chains with costs rallying up against the farm-gate value (Hummels, 2007).\n\nOn the other hand, agricultural products have long held an exceptional place in international trade, with protectionist policies being the norm rather than the exception. The sector is often described as remaining sheltered from the large reductions in tariffs, and it is only with the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement that modest tariff cuts were agreed (Bureau et al., 2019). A host of tariff and non-tariff barriers impede the trade of agri-food products.1 Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ)\nmechanisms are the dominant form of tariff barrier in agricultural trade where the destination market rations the volume of exports by charging prohibitive tariffs on exports above certain thresholds (Skully, 2007).\n\nIn this paper, our setting resembles the case of exporting under licensing TRQ mechanisms, which are the most common implementation method of TRQ mechanisms (Hranaiova et al., 2006). A licensing mechanism operates in the following manner. Before the quota period begins, potential exporters are invited to apply for export licenses. Applicants specify their intended quantity of exports. After an exporter receives a license, he/she has the right to export their allocated license quantities at a lower tariff rate which would apply if export is done without a license. Deviating from the allocated license quantities involves penalties. Many countries also specify a minimum license amount (Skully, 1987). Such a minimum quantity commitment (MQC), the term we use in this paper, specifies the minimum license quantity that can be allocated to an exporter. Some examples are provided next.\n\nThe Australian government sets MQCs for some commodities as follows: 1 tonne for EU high quality beef, 500 tonnes for cotton exported to India, 1 tonne for carrots and potatoes exported to Indonesia, 1 tonne for FTA (Free Trade Agreement) butter and\n(Gourdon et al., 2020).\n\nfor FTA cheddar cheese for export to the United States of America, among others.2 The Australian government also indicates penalties for underused quota entitlements, and that the amount of the allocation penalty is the amount of the person's tariff rate quota entitlement for the quota type in the next quota year.3 In Canada, license holders that are unable to use their licenses will have their allocations in the following year adjusted downward in proportion to the amount they did not use.4 The UK government indicates that new sugar export applicants must provide evidence to prove that they have exported at least 25 tonnes of sugar during the 12-month period ending two months before the first application.5\nIn the contemporary landscape of international trade, small and medium-sized enterprises\n(SMEs) often find themselves facing formidable challenges when competing against larger industry counterparts. The inherent limitations of SMEs, such as restricted capital, limited production capacity, and narrower market access, can impede their ability to compete on a global scale (Fliess and Busquets, 2006). This hinders the profitability of trade and deprives such enterprises from important growth opportunities.\n\nBy joining forces through collaborative initiatives, SMEs can pool their resources, share expertise, and collectively navigate the complexities of international trade. This collaborative approach not only mitigates individual weaknesses but also creates synergies that enhance the overall competitiveness of the participating SMEs. There is a considerable amount of evidence and research on how SMEs can facilitate their access to global markets through collaborative exporter groups, a.k.a. exporter consortia (e.g., Forte and Oliveira (2019)).6\n6The export consortia agreement signed by five Jordanian food supplements factories is a real-world example of successful collaboration supporting SMEs in Jordan. This joint effort aims to boost the private sector's contribution to job creation and economic inclusion, particularly for youth and women. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, the collaboration focuses on leveraging the valuable knowledge within the local food supplement sector to explore export markets.\n\nThis initiative, extended to sectors like garment and fashion, natural cosmetics, and food supplements exemplifies a collective endeavor to access non-traditional markets. Notably, the agreement with professional uniform clothing manufacturers aims to create an integrated collection targeting east Africa, demonstrating the potential for collaborative ventures to open new opportunities for SMEs.\n\nExport consortia emerge as collaborative solutions, enabling SMEs to pool resources for joint export initiatives. Still, clear mechanisms for cost/gain sharing in such consortia have never been discussed. In this paper, we model cooperative games associated with agri-food export consortia, taking into account practical challenges such as MQCs, and examine cost/gain sharing mechanisms with desirable properties that could stabilize such organizations.\n\nWe construct a model wherein SMEs engage in the production of a certain agri-food commodity and, in line with a requirement of common market access mechanisms, are required to commit to the quantities they intend to export to a specific international market. The committed export quantity has to be at least as large as a predefined MQC that is established by regulatory authorities.\n\nInitially, we analyze the optimal order quantities for each exporting company based on their costs and profit margins, leading to a categorization of firms according to their export strategies. Our focus then shifts to the examination of cooperation among SMEs, specifically those whose individual capacities fall below the MQC, a.k.a., SMEs. We demonstrate that identifying the optimal coalition of firms for export is an NP-Hard problem. The rationale for such cooperation becomes evident, as no single company or group has an incentive to abandon the grand coalition due to a profit distribution rule that satisfies all SMEs. Additionally, we explore two profit distribution rules to justly compensate complementary SMEs, those that individually find exporting unprofitable but do so for the benefit of the group. Finally, we provide several illustrative examples showcasing optimal benefits and orders for cooperating SMEs, applying and discussing various proposed profit distribution rules This paper is organized into five sections. Section 2 provides a review of the related literature.\n\nSubsequently, Section 3 introduces definitions and notations in cooperative game theory. In Section 4, we present the individual export model, both with and without an MQC, examining the behavior of exporters and their optimal order size. Moving to Section 5, we analyze a model derived from scenarios where multiple SMEs, each with a MQC, collaborate to form a coalition. This section ranks the SMEs based on their costs and benefits, determining their optimal order size. In Section 6, we examine the cooperative model and demonstrate that identifying the subset of firms within a coalition that should engage in export activities to achieve the optimal profit is an NP-hard problem. Section 7 defines the cooperative game arising from this model, explores its primary properties, and establishes the stability (in the sense of the core) of the Non-essential Exporter Altruistic rule, distributing all profits among exporters without allocating any to others. Section 8 shifts focus to two alternative profit allocation methods that compensate complementary enterprises for their contribution to the overall profit increase. Finally, Section 9 offers a comprehensive summary of the paper's outcomes and contributions, concluding with suggestions for future research directions.\n"

        "content": "\nThe literature on international trade in operations, logistics, and supply chain management is scarce but growing.\n\nIn Charoenwong et al. (2023), the authors employ firm-level global supply chain data, transaction-level shipping container data, and policy uncertainty indexes from prominent media outlets to investigate the correlation between policy uncertainty and shifts in supply chain networks.\n\nFan et al. (2022) provide an overview of operations and supply chain management research incorporating the role of political economy in global trade. Lam et al. (2022) investigate the impact of foreign competition on the product quality of domestic firms. Dong and Kouvelis (2020) examine the contemporary research on global supply chain management and study the effect of tariffs on the configuration of the global supply chain networks. Cohen and Lee (2020) explores research opportunities on how global supply chain modeling can inform the way firms react to changes in relevant government policies for manufacturing and logistics, including tariffs, content requirements, taxes, and investment incentives. Nagurney et al. (2019a,b,c) developed a spatialprice network equilibrium model of TRQ mechanisms to analyze the joint export quantity decisions, route selection, and equilibrium prices. This paper contributes to this line of work by introducing a pragmatic approach to cooperation among SME exporters to bypass challenges posed by MQC requirements in international trade.\n\nThere is a substantial body of work on trade mechanisms in the economics literature. Among the most notable contributions is Skully (1987) who develops a basic static model for TRQs and investigates different administration methods, including FCFS and license on demand. In Boughner et al. (2000), the authors study the economic effects of TRQ mechanism following the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, focusing on changes in tariffs, quotas, and market conditions. They emphasize how export quota allocation and distribution procedures impact TRQ efficiency. Gervais and Surprenant (2003) examines the impact of discretionary and non-discretionary methods for allocating TRQs in the Canadian chicken industry. Larue et al. (2007) compares export tariffs and quotas in Canada's dairy industry, managed by a marketing board. The study explores welfare rankings between price-equivalent quotas and tariffs, considering different assumptions about the marketing board's powers. Hezarkhani et al. (2023) examines the logistical issues associated with TRQ mechanisms in international trade and show how the lead-time, warehousing, and the choice of logistics channel impact the performance of TRQ mechanisms in terms of fill-rate and policymaker's revenue. Central to this paper is overcoming the constraints imposed by licensing TRQ\nmechanisms with regard to MQCs through cooperation.\n\nThis paper examines the horizontal collaboration among producers in international supply chains. It applies cooperative game theory to establish appropriate ways to share gains among cooperating enterprises in supply chains (see Lozano et al. (2013) for a review of application domains in this context). Cooperative game theory has been used to address many supply chain problems, inasmuch as there are review papers tailored to specific contexts\u2014e.g., cooperative transportation\n(Cruijssen et al., 2007), cooperative logistics network design (Hezarkhani et al., 2021), cooperative inventory management (Fiestras-Janeiro et al., 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015), cooperation in assembly systems Bernstein et al. (2015), cooperative sequencing (Curiel et al., 2002), cooperative advertising (J\u00f8rgensen and Zaccour, 2014), cooperative distribution chain (Guardiola et al., 2007) and (Guardiola et al., 2023) among others. Still, there are many ad hoc application domains, e.g., cooperative procurement Hezarkhani and So\u02c7si\u00b4c (2019), responsible sourcing (Fang and Cho, 2020), vaccination supply chains (Westerink-Duijzer et al., 2020). In Nagarajan and So\u02c7si\u00b4c (2008), Meca and Timmer (2008) and Rzeczycki (2022) we find different surveys that examine the applications of cooperative game theory in the context of supply chain management. Our work constitutes yet another area of supply chain management which can be fruitfully analyzed through cooperative game theory.\n\nOperations research has been intertwined with cooperative game theory to develop dedicated methods. Anily and Haviv (2010) and Karsten et al. (2015) study cooperation in service systems where enterprises pool capacities to serve costumers and studies the core of these games. Armony et al. (2021) further incorporates the strategic behaviour of customers in analyzing the pooling in service queues. He et al. (2012) further examines the submodularity of objective functions in joint replenishment games. Liu et al. (2018) introduces an instrument for maintaining the stability of grand coalitions by penalizing the deviations of the enterprises. Fang and Cho (2014) studies cooperative inventory transshipment games where endogenous coalition formation is allowed. Our paper combines OR models with the concept of core to characterizes conditions for stable cooperation among SME exporters to international markets.\n"

        "title": "3 Preliminaries Cooperative Game Theory",
        "content": "\nA cooperative game with transferable utility (TU-game) comprises a set of players N = {1, 2, ..., n}\nand a characteristic function v, which associates each subset of N with a real number. The subsets of N are referred to as coalitions, denoted by S. Formally, the characteristic function is a mapping v : 2N \u2212\u2192 R such that v(\u2205) = 0. The value v(S) of the characteristic function represents the maximum benefit that members of the coalition S can achieve through cooperation. The coalition consisting of all agents, N, is termed the grand coalition. The subgame related to coalition S, is the restriction of the mapping v to the subcoalitions of S.\n\nOne of the central inquiries in cooperative game theory revolves around the equitable distribution of benefits within the grand coalition after its formation. This distribution is achieved through allocations, represented by a vector x \u2208 Rn, where n denotes the number of players in the set N.\n\nThe class of superadditive games is particularly intriguing, serving as a motivation for the establishment of the grand coalition as it guarantees maximum profits for the coalition. Formally, a transferable utility (TU) game (*N, v*) is deemed superadditive if, for every two coalitions S, T \u2286 N with S \u2229 T = \u2205, it holds that v(S \u222a T) \u2265 v(S) + v(T). Furthermore, TU-games characterized by higher profits for larger coalitions are termed strictly increasing monotone games. This can be expressed equivalently as v(S) \u2264 v(T) for all S \u2286 T \u2286 N. An imputation for the game (*N, v*) is an the game is denoted by I(N, v).\n\nallocation which verifies \ufffd\ni\u2208N xi = v(N) and xi \u2265 v({i}) for all i \u2208 N. The set of imputations of Cooperative game theory provides diverse approaches for dividing the profits arising from collaboration. Two main categories of solutions exist: set solutions and point solutions. Set solutions involve the exclusion of allocations that fail to meet specific conditions, retaining only those that do. On the other hand, point solutions are derived through axiomatic characterization, meaning they are the unique allocations that satisfy specific properties.\n\nThe core of a game is defined as the primary set solution. It encompasses all efficient allocations that maintain coalition stability, meaning no coalition has a motivation to exit the grand coalition without diminishing its overall profit. In formal terms,\n\n$$Core(N,v)=\\left\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}:\\sum_{i\\in N}x_{i}=v(N)\\text{and}\\sum_{i\\in S}x_{i}\\geq v(S),\\forall S\\subset N\\right\\}.$$\nThe findings by Bondareva (1963) and Shapley et al. (1967) offer a crucial criterion: the core of a TU game is guaranteed to be non-empty if and only if the game is balanced. This represents a key theorem in cooperative game theory. It is a totally balanced game if the core of every subgame is nonempty. Totally balanced games were introduced in Shapley and Shubik (1969). A game (*N, v*)\nis regarded as convex if for all i \u2208 N and all *S, T* \u2286 N such that S \u2286 T \u2282 N with i \u2208 S, then v(S)\u2212v(S\\{i}) \u2264 v(T)\u2212v(T \\{i}). It is widely acknowledged that convex games are superadditive, and superadditive games are totally balanced. Shapley (1971) establishes that convex games are balanced and its core is large enough.\n\nThe nucleolus, a notable solution, is based on a notion of social equity. This solution relies on the concept of excess. Given a cooperative game (*N, v*) and an allocation x \u2208 Rn, for any S \u2282 N the the degree of dissatisfaction of coalition S with the selected allocation x. The coalition with the excess of S with respect to x is defined by e(*S, x*) = \ufffd\ni\u2208S xi \u2212 v(S). The excess function measures smallest excess is the coalition that most disagrees with the allocation. For any allocation x \u2208 Rn, let \u03b8(x) = (e(*S, x*))S\u2286N;S\u0338=\u2205 \u2208 R2n\u22121 be the vector of the excesses of the coalitions with respect to x with the coordinates rearranged in decreasing order. The nucleolus is the set of imputations which lexicographically maximizes the vector of excesses.\n\n$$\\eta(N,v)=\\left\\{x\\in I(N,v):\\theta(x)\\succeq_{l e x}\\theta(y),\\forall y\\in I(N,v)\\right\\}$$\nwhere \u03b8(x) \u2ab0lex \u03b8(y) means \u03b8(x) = \u03b8(y) or there exists l, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 2n \u2212 1, such that \u03b8k(x) =\n\u03b8k(y) for all *k < l,* and \u03b8l(x) *> \u03b8*l(y). Although the nucleolus is defined as subsets of allocations, Schmeidler (1969) showed that each consists of a unique allocation. The nucleolus of a game whose core is non-empty belongs to the core and it is considered as the lexicographical centre of the core.\n\nA point solution \u03c6 refers to a function that, for each TU-game (*N, v*), determines an allocation of v(N). Formally, we have \u03c6 : GN \u2212\u2192 Rn, where GN denotes the class of all TU-games with player set N, and \u03c6i(*N, v*) represents the profit assigned to player i \u2208 N in the game v \u2208 GN.\n\nTherefore, \u03c6(*N, v*) = (\u03c6i(*N, v*))i\u2208N is a profit vector or allocation of v(N). The nucleolus is a point solution. For a comprehensive overview of cooperative game theory, we recommend referring to Gonz\u00b4alez-D\u0131az et al. (2010).\n"

        "content": "\nA set of enterprises N = {1*, ..., n*} produce a common agri-food commodity. Each enterprise has the option to supply domestic market or export to international markets. For an arbitrary enterprise i \u2208 N, we denote the production capacity with Qi > 0 which indicates the maximum amount of produce that the enterprise can supply. We normalize the cost of production to zero for all enterprises.\n\nEnterprises must decide how much to export.7 But prior to that, an enterprise wishing to engage in exports must commit a specific quantity of export to the export control authority. This can be in the form of acquiring export licenses under a TRQ mechanism.8 The export commitment level of enterprise i is denoted with mi \u2265 0. That is, the export volume committed by the enterprise and approved by the export control authority. After making a commitment and at the time of export, an enterprise i needs to decide the export quantity which is denoted by 0 \u2264 qi \u2264 Qi.\n\nFor every unit of exported produce, enterprises gain the export revenue p \u2265 0. W.l.o.g, we normalize the revenue for supplying to domestic market to zero. To be able to export, however, the enterprise i has to incur a fix cost ci \u2265 0 in order to prepare the produce for international market. For instance, this pertains to measures specific to production or those related to sanitary and phytosanitary requirements mandated by the target market.\n\nDeviating from a committed export volume entails two types of penalties: per unit over-supply penalty ro \u2265 0, and per unit under-supply penalty ru \u2265 0. For example, in case the commodity is subject to a TRQ mechanism, if an enterprise exports above the volume of licenses that it posses, an over-quota tariff rate will be applied to every unit of excess export. Under-supply penalty can be applied per unit or be in terms of sanctions for future exports. For example, many governments curtail the future access to licenses for an enterprise who fails to fulfil its committed volume of exports.\n\nIt is a customary practice for authorities to establish a minimum threshold for the export commitment level (see the introduction for specific examples). We call this a minimum quantity commitment (henceforth MQC) and denote it with m \u2265 0. Thus, in order for an enterprise i to export, it must make a commitment at least as large as the MQC, that is, mi \u2265 m. The presence of positive MQCs has significant impacts on export decisions as we examine next.\n\npay the corresponding penalty.

The case of committing to zero exports (mi = 0) and the subsequent decision to export nothing (qi = 0), leading to the normalized profit of zero, is used as the benchmark against any positive export strategy.

If the combined capacity of the essential players is large enough to match or surpass the MQC, then no other players would be exporting. However, if the combined capacity of essential players falls short of MQC, it could be optimal for some complementary players to export as well. Although these players do not have non-negative full capacity margins, their inclusion could be beneficial as they could reduce the under-supply penalty imposed to the essential players if they export on their own. Altogether, optimal export decisions of the complementary SMEs in a coalition depends on the capacities of the essential SMEs in that coalition. Theorem 1 reveals the intrinsic power of the essential players. If a player is essential, it always exports in a coalition which exports at optimality. The optimal profit of a coalition is bounded by their aggregate full capacity export margins, as shown in the next corollary.\n\nAs shown by Theorem 1, the exporting SMEs in a coalition only includes complementary players Corollary 1.

Property (i) asserts that the total full capacity margin of optimal complementary players in sub-coalitions, which include a subset of essential players, is never larger than that in the grand coalition. Considering that full capacity margins are negative for complementary players, in absolute terms, the grand coalition employs a set of complementary players with a smaller or equal full capacity margin. Property (ii) is a technical observation which helps in proving the subsequent results. The next proposition elucidates the main properties of CE-games, including superadditivity.\n\nProposition 3.

Property (iii) states that CE-games are superadditive. Consequently, the formation of the grand coalition is justified. On the other hand, property (iv) shows that the game is monotone increasing.\n\nBefore exploring the allocation of profits from this cooperation among the players, we illustrate a three-player CE-situation and its associated game with an example.\n\n| S    | R   |\n|------|-----|\n| S    |     |\n| |    |     |\n| (    | S   |\n| \\    |     |\n| R    |     |\n| S    |     |\n| )    | v   |\n| {    |     |\n| 1    |     |\n| }    | \u2205|{ |\n| 1    |     |\n| }    |     |\n| 0    |     |\n| {    |     |\n| 2    |     |\n| }    |     |\n| {    |     |\n| 2    |     |\n| }|\u2205  |     |\n| 406  |     |\n| {    |     |\n| 3    |     |\n| }    | {   |\n| 3    |     |\n| }|\u2205  |     |\n| 18   |     |\n| {    |     |\n| 1    | ,   |\n| }    | {   |\n| 1    | ,   |\n| }|\u2205  |     |\n| 825  |     |\n| {    |     |\n| 1    | ,   |\n| }    |     |\n| {    |     |\n| 1    | ,   |\n| }|\u2205  |     |\n| 437  |     |\n| {    |     |\n| 2    | ,   |\n| }    | {   |\n| 2    | ,   |\n| }|\u2205  |     |\n| 1034 |     |\n| {    |     |\n| 1    | ,   |\n| }    | {   |\n| 1    | ,   |\n| }|\u2205  |     |\n| 1383 |     |\n\nExample 1. Consider a scenario with three players N = {1, 2, 3}*. We have* Q1 = 14 , Q2 = 33, Q3 = 21, c1 = 15, c2 = 7, c3 = 23*. Let* p = 21, m = 61*, and* ru = 10. The coalitions' optimal profits and strategies are shown in Table 1.\n\nAll players are essential, but player 1 cannot export profitably on his own unlike the other two players who could do so individually. Any coalition that is formed of two or more players will export profitably. Note that this game is not convex: 349 = v({1, 2, 3}) \u2212 v({2, 3}) *< v*({1, 2}) \u2212 v({2}) =\n419. We can find stable allocations in the core for this game. For instance, distributing the benefits of the grand coalition proportionally to \u2206i *among all essential players, that is* (279, 686, 418), gives an allocation in the core.\n\nThe CE-games are not generally convex as seen in Example 1, thus the Shapley value (Shapley,\n1953) is not necessarily in the core (in addition to being computationally challenging). We now introduce the NEA-allocation rule which is always in the core and also computationally easy to calculate.\n\nLet (*N, Q, C, p, m*) be a CE-situation, and let (*N, v*) be the corresponding CE-game, we define\n\nthe allocation $\\phi(N,v)=(\\phi_{i}(N,v))_{i\\in N}$ as follows:\n\n$$\\phi_{i}(N,v):=\\begin{cases}\\dfrac{\\Delta_{i}}{\\sum_{j\\in N^{E}}\\Delta_{j}}v(N)&\\text{if}i\\in N^{E}\\\\ 0&\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}\\tag{10}$$\n\nThe above allocation rule divides the gains of the grand coalition among the essential players\nproportional to their individual full capacity margins. All other players will receive zero benefit from cooperative exporting. This includes the the complementary SMEs who do export along with\n\n| S   | R   |\n|-----|-----|\n| S   |     |\n| |   |     |\n| (   | S   |\n| \\   |     |\n| R   |     |\n| S   |     |\n| )   | v   |\n| {   |     |\n| 1   |     |\n| }   | \u2205|{ |\n| 1   |     |\n| }   |     |\n| 0   |     |\n| {   |     |\n| 2   |     |\n| }   |     |\n| \u2205|{ |     |\n| 2   |     |\n| }   |     |\n| 0   |     |\n| {   |     |\n| 3   |     |\n| }   | \u2205|{ |\n| 3   |     |\n| }   |     |\n| 0   |     |\n| {   |     |\n| 1   | ,   |\n| }   | {   |\n| 1   | ,   |\n| }|\u2205 |     |\n| 9   |     |\n| {   |     |\n| 1   | ,   |\n| }   |     |\n| {   |     |\n| 1   | ,   |\n| }|\u2205 |     |\n| 5.5 |     |\n| {   |     |\n| 2   | ,   |\n| }   | {   |\n| 2   | ,   |\n| }|\u2205 |     |\n| 5.5 |     |\n| {   |     |\n| 1   | ,   |\n| }   | {   |\n| 1   | ,   |\n| }|\u2205 |     |\n| 13  |     |\n\nthe essential players, i.e., DN. So, complementary SMEs' participation in the export consortia has to be without any expectations for receiving a positive gain. Due to this feature, we will call this allocation Non-essential Exporter Altruistic rule (henceforth NEA rule).\n\nThe next theorem shows that the NEA rule is coalitionally stable in the sense of the core.\n\nTheorem 2. Let (N, Q, C, p, m) be a CE-situation, and let (N, v) be the corresponding CE-game. Then, NEA rule, as defined in equation (10), belongs to the core of the game.\n\nFollowing the above theorem, CE-games are balanced. It is easy to see that every subgame of CE-games is also a CE-game. Thus, CE-games are totally balanced.\n\nAs illustrated by Example 1, in situations where complementary players are absent, the NEA\nrule emerges as a fair method for distributing the benefits generated by the grand coalition. Nevertheless, in the subsequent scenario involving the same number of SMEs, it becomes evident that not all exporting players see the benefits of their cooperation.\n\nExample 2. Consider a scenario with three players N = {1, 2, 3}*. We have* Q1 = 5 , Q2 = 5, Q3 = 6, c1 = 20, c2 = 20, c3 = 35*. Let* p = 5.5, m = 11*, and* ru = 6. The coalitions' optimal profits and strategies are shown in Table 2.\n\nIn this example, players 1 and 2 are essential while player 3 is complementary. Although player\n3 exports with either 1 or 2, as well as in the grand coalition, the NEA rule distributes the profit in the following way: \u03d5(*N, v*) = (6.5, 6.5, 0), allocating no profit to player 3. Nevertheless, there still exists alternative allocations in the core that could give as much as 4 units of profit to player 3 (for example, consider the allocation (4.5, 4.5, 4).\n\nTo address the incentive issues of the complementary exporting players, a possible alternative to the NEA rule would be to consider distributing the benefits of the grand coalition proportionally to \u03b4i for all exporters (essential and complementary). Consider then the following proportional allocation:\n\n$$\\omega_{i}(N,v):=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\frac{\\delta_{i}}{\\sum_{j\\in R^{N}}\\delta_{j}}v(N)}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}i\\in R^{N}}}\\\\ {{0}}&{{\\mathrm{otherwise}}}\\end{array}\\right.$$\nHere, all exporting players receive an allocation proportional to their \u03b4i, and therefore we will call\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}{{}}\\\\ {{}}\\end{array}$$\nit \u03b4-proportional rule. Since all exporting players are compensated based on the same criteria, there is a natural 'fairness' intuition associated with this solution. Unfortunately, this allocation is not necessarily in the core.\n\nA counterexample can be observed in Example 2 where we get\n\u03c9(*N, v*) = (4.47, 4.47, 4.06).\n\nWith this allocation we have v({1, 2}) = 8.94 < 9 which violates stability condition for this coalition.\n\nConsidering the nucleolus allocation for this example, we get \u03b7(*N, v*) = (5.5, 5.5, 2).\n\nIt removes one unit from each essential player and gives it to the complementary exporting player. The nucleolus also obtains a stable allocation in the sense of the core for these games, which are balanced. However, as the number of players increases, computing the nucleolus becomes computationally challenging. Perea and Puerto (2019) proposes a heuristic approach for calculating the nucleolus, which is based on sampling the coalitions space.\n\nAlthough the NEA rule is in the core and it is computationally straightforward, it does not give any extra value to the complementary players that are part of the optimal exporters in N. Thus, one can argue that the NEA rule does not provide sufficient incentives for complementary exporting players to participate in the coalition even when their help is needed to achieve the economy of scale required for export. We address this issue next by refining the NEA rule by means of compensatory policies for complementary exporting players. In the following section, we introduce two alternative allocations, easily computable, aimed at compensating complementary exporting players for their contributions to the collective export benefit.\n"

To do so, we will use the excess function for coalitions under NEA rule \u03d5(*N, v*). That is, for a coalition S \u2282 N, let e(S, \u03d5(*N, v*)) =\n\ufffd\ni\u2208S \u03d5i(*N, v*) \u2212 v(S).\n\nNote that since \u03d5(N, v) \u2208 Core(*N, v*) we have e(S, \u03d5(*N, v*)) \u2265 0 for all S \u2286 N.

However, as our next result shows, such sub-coalitions can only be among certain groups of coalitions. Consider Mi(*N, v*) = v(N) \u2212 v(N *\\ {*i}) as the marginal contribution of player i.\n\nLemma 4. Let (N, Q, C, p, m) be a CE-situation, and let (N, v) be the corresponding CE-game.\n\nGiven the NEA rule \u03d5(N, v), we have either \u02c6S = N \\ {i\u2217} for i\u2217 \u2208 N such that Mi\u2217(N, v) \u2212\nMi(N, v) \u2264 \u03d5i\u2217(N, v) \u2212 \u03d5i(N, v) for all i \u2208 N*, or* \u02c6S = (N \\ NE) \u222a {i\u2217} *for* i\u2217 \u2208 arg mini\u2208NE \u2206i.\n\nThe first possibility for the sub-coalition with minimum excess per number of essential players is the coalition which has only one essential player less than the grand coalition. The absent player, i\u2217, in this case is the essential player who receives the closest allocation to his/her maximum possible allocatable gain under the original NEA rule. Note that in this case we have | \u02c6S| \u2208 {1, n \u2212 1}. The second possibility for the sub-coalition with minimum excess per number of essential players is the coalition which includes all non-essential players and only the essential player with the minimum full capacity export margin. Figuring out \u02c6S allows us to calculate the maximum fix rate that can be deducted from the essential players to be redistributed among the complementary exporting players. The following result provides a sufficient condition for the egalitarian essential rate rule to belong to the core of the game.\n\nTheorem 3. Let (N, Q, C, p, m) be a CE-situation, and let (N, v) be the corresponding CE-game.\n\nIf DN \u0338= \u2205*, for every* 0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 e( \u02c6S,\u03d5(N,v))\n| \u02c6SE|\nthe allocation rule \u03c8\u03c1(N, v) is in the core of the associated game.\n\nIn light of the previous result, we have an interval to select an appropriate \u03c1 within which so that the egalitarian essential rate allocation is stable in the sense of the core. However, we can set further criteria for choosing the appropriate \u03c1, which more 'fairly' compensates complementary exporting players. Therefore, we establish the proportional allocation in (11) as a reference for compensation for complementary exporting players, which, despite not belonging to the core, distributes profit proportionally to the under-supply adjusted (full capacity) margin of exporting players, and in that sense treats all players in a same way. With this objective in mind, we let \u03b1i = \u03b4i for all i \u2208 DN, and define\n\n$$\\rho^{E}:=\\min\\left\\{\\frac{e(\\hat{S},\\phi(N,v))}{|\\hat{S}^{E}|},\\frac{v(N)\\sum_{j\\in D^{N}}\\delta_{j}}{|N^{E}|\\sum_{j\\in D^{N}}\\delta_{j}}\\right\\}.\\tag{13}$$\n\nOne can observe that in this way, if the the second expression is less than or equal to the first expres\nsions, then the egalitarian essential allocation generates the same allocations for complementary exporting players as that in (11) while ensuring that the resultant allocation is in the core.\n"

Let (\u03b1i)i\u2208DN be a system of non-negative weights for complementary exporting players in the grand coalition. Given \u03c1 \u2265 0, the *proportional essential rate* allocation rule \u03c6\u03c1(*N, v*) =\n(\u03c6\u03c1\ni (*N, v*))i\u2208N is defined as follows:\n\n$$\\varphi_{i}^{\\rho}(N,v)=\\begin{cases}(1-\\rho)\\phi_{i}(N,v)&\\text{if}i\\in N^{E}\\\\ \\dfrac{\\alpha_{i}}{\\sum_{j\\in D^{N}}\\alpha_{j}}\\rho v(N)&\\text{if}i\\in D^{N}\\\\ 0&\\text{if}i\\in N\\setminus R^{N}\\end{cases}$$\n\nThe proportional essential rate allocation rule charges an amount $\\phi_{i}(N,v)\\rho\\geq0$ from every es \nsential player, after allocating gains among players according the NEA rule \u03d5(*N, v*), and then redistributes the aggregated amount among the complementary exporting players according to the weights (\u03b1i)i\u2208DN .\n\nConsider the ratio of the excess value under the NEA rule assigned to a coalition which contains at least an essential player, and the aggregated allocation of that coalition under the NEA rule. Among these values of all feasible sub-coalition, we highlight the sub-coalition with the minimum ratio:\n\n$$\\hat{S}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{S\\in\\hat{N},\\hat{S}\\neq\\emptyset}\\frac{e(S,\\phi(N,v))}{\\sum_{v\\in\\hat{S}}\\phi_{i}(N,v)}.\\tag{14}$$\n\nThe following result shows that the coalition where the ratio is minimised, $\\hat{S}$, can be found amongst \na restricted set of possible sub-coalitions.\n\nLemma 5.

But he does not have sufficient quantity. Players 2 and 3 are symmetric with mid levels of efficiency and quantity. These three players are essential. Player 4 has the largest quantity but he is extremely inefficient, i.e., with a high cost. Thus player 4 is complementary. Table 4 exhibits the comparison among the rules studied in this research as well as the nucleolus.\n\nPlayer 4 has an extremely high cost compare to the other three players so \u22064 < 0 and as such this is a complementary player. In the end, the NEA allocation rule gives him nothing, although the \u03b4-proportional rule gives this player as high as 42. Our allocation rules recommend a maximum of \u03c1E = 3.12 egalitarian payment from the three essential players 1,2,3, or \u03c1P = 0.05 of their NEA\nallocation back as tax ratio to compensate player 4. This gives the player 4 a maximum of 9.35 units of gained profit.\n\nTo exhibit the burden of player 4 to the rest of the players, consider an alternative situation where an additional efficient player 5, with same quantity as player 4, Q5 = Q4, but c5 = 5. Then the optimal set of exporters does not include player 4 and the essential players have increased their gains (under NEA allocation rule) to \u03d5\u2032\n1 = 59, \u03d5\u2032\n2 = 65, and \u03d5\u2032\n3 = 65, that is around 15% increase on average.\n\nExample 4.

Specifically, in example 5 the nucleolus punishes player 1 with more than 50% of their profit while compensating not only the complementary player (player 3) but also the rest of the essential players (players 2 and 4). In example 4, it harms the essential player 3 with more than 25% of their profit.

        "content": "\nInternational trade presents significant opportunities for agri-food communities to generate profits.\n\nHowever, for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), accessing international markets can be financially prohibitive, particularly under trade policies that impose minimum quantity commitments (MQCs) on export volumes, such as licensing tariff rate quota (TRQ) mechanisms.\n\nIn our study, we aim to address this challenging context with the goal of developing optimal strategies to facilitate international market exportation for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). The central idea is to design collaborative approaches, such as the formation of export consortia, that enable SMEs to join forces to overcome inherent barriers in global competition. In this regard, the implementation of strategies focused on export commitment and the optimization of the agri-food supply chain will be crucial.\n\nBy fostering collaboration and synergy between SMEs, we aim to contribute to a more robust and competitive commercial ecosystem where both types of businesses can mutually thrive in the international market. Adaptability in the face of global uncertainty will be a key element in our proposals, ensuring the long-term viability of these strategies in a dynamic business environment.\n\nThis paper demonstrates how cooperative exporting among agri-food SMEs can effectively overcome the challenges posed by MQCs, thereby expanding market access to a wider array of SMEs. By formulating a class of cooperative games tailored to these scenarios, we identify a gain-sharing mechanism that ensures allocations within their respective cores, facilitating the formation of stable grand coalitions among cooperative exporting SMEs.\n\nOur proposed allocation NEA-rule distributes the export surplus exclusively among the \"essential\" SME exporters\u2014those that demonstrate sufficient cost efficiency. Consequently, less costefficient \"complementary\" SMEs, whose capacities are essential for meeting MQCs, do not directly benefit from collaborative exporting and must participate altruistically.\n\nTo address this issue, we suggest two modifications to our original allocation rule aimed at sharing a portion of the export surplus with complementary SMEs through taxing the essential SMEs. These modifications include an egalitarian approach, which we called Egalitarian essential rate, and a revenue-based rate approach, called Proportional essential rate. Through numerical examples, we compare the performance of these allocation mechanisms and discuss their practical implications for cooperative exporting strategies in agri-food communities.\n\nFuture research in this domain could explore several avenues to further enhance our understanding and implementation of cooperative exporting strategies among agri-food SMEs. Firstly, investigating attainable allocations through the lens of a potential-based mechanism (PMAS) could offer insights into more dynamic and adaptive gain-sharing approaches, taking into account the evolving needs and capacities of participating SMEs. Secondly, delving into detailed characterizations of the proposed solutions, including their stability, fairness, and scalability under various market conditions and policy frameworks, would provide a deeper understanding of their practical implications and limitations. Finally, applying these cooperative exporting models to real-world data from agri-food exporting companies would offer empirical validation and refinement, enabling the development of more tailored and effective strategies to promote inclusive and sustainable international trade within the agricultural sector.\n"

It is straightforward to verify above since without any restriction on mi, and non-negative deviation penalties, it is always optimal to match export quantity with the commitment level, that is, q\u2217\ni = m\u2217\ni . This simplifies the profit function to \u2206i1qi>0 and subsequently we get the two possibilities as stated above.\n\nProof of Lemma 2. If Qi \u2265 m, the MQC would not affect the optimal solution and, similar to the\n\ncase in the previous section, we get q\u2217\n                                     i = m\u2217\n                                            i = Qi if \u2206i \u2265 0 and q\u2217\n                                                                   i = m\u2217\n                                                                         i = 0 otherwise. Thus, for\n\nthe rest of the proof we assume Qi < m.\n\nSince Qi < m, upon exporting there will be under supply penalty. Thus the best choice of\n\ncommitment if qi > 0 is m\u2217\n                       i = m. The profit in this case is\n\n$$\\Pi(q_{i},\\underline{{{m}}})=q_{i}(p+r^{u})-c_{i}-\\underline{{{m}}}r^{u}$$\nThe first part is increasing on qi thus maximum profit is Qi(p + rU) \u2212 ci \u2212 mru. If this value is positive, that is, \u03b4i \u2265 mru, then we have q\u2217\ni = Qi. Otherwise, we have q\u2217\ni = m\u2217\ni = 0.\n\nProof of Theorem 1. Let RS \u2286 S be the subset of players in S such as qS\ni > 0 for all i \u2208 RS. We assume that cooperating via the export coalition is beneficial, that is, RS \u0338= \u2205. By Lemma 2, we have qS\ni = Qi for all i \u2208 RS. We consider the cases in the statement of the theorem in sequence:\nWe first show that SE \u2286 RS.

Note that by definition\n\nof complementary players, for any i \u2208 RS \\ SE we have \u2206i < 0 which obtains \u03a0(qS, mS) \u2264\n\ufffd\n  i\u2208SE \u2206i.\n\nby Theorem 1 (B) that SE \u2286 RS. Consider \u03a0S(SE) as the profit function for coalition S in the Proof of Proposition 1. Take S \u2208 N and suppose suppose that \ufffd\ni\u2208SE Qi *< m*. If RS \u0338= \u2205, we know solution in which only the essential players export all of their capacity. Thus we can write\n\n$$\\Pi^{S}(S^{E})+G^{S}(D)=\\sum_{i\\in S^{E}}\\Delta_{i}-\\left(\\underline{m}-\\sum_{i\\in S^{E}}Q_{i}\\right)^{+}r^{u}+\\sum_{i\\in D}\\Delta_{i}+\\min\\left\\{\\underline{m}-\\sum_{i\\in S^{E}}Q_{i}\\sum_{i\\in D}Q_{i}\\right\\}r^{u}$$ $$=\\sum_{i\\in S^{E}}\\Delta_{i}+\\sum_{i\\in D}\\Delta_{i}-\\left(\\underline{m}-\\sum_{i\\in S^{E}}Q_{i}\\right)r^{u}+\\min\\left\\{\\underline{m}-\\sum_{i\\in S^{E}}Q_{i}\\sum_{i\\in D}Q_{i}\\right\\}r^{u}$$ $$=\\sum_{i\\in S^{E}\\cup D}\\Delta_{i}-\\left(\\underline{m}\\sum_{i\\in S^{E}\\cup D}Q_{i}\\right)^{+}r^{u}=\\Pi^{S}(S^{E}\\cup D)$$\n\nHence, finding optimal $R^{S}$ boils down to finding optimal $D$ for $G^{S}$; that is, $D^{S}\\in\\arg\\max_{D\\subseteq S^{C}}G^{S}(D)$.\n\nProof of Proposition 2. Consider DS such that maxD\u2286SC{GS(D)} = GS(DS). Assume that DS in non empty. Suppose DS \u0338= \u2205 and let M = m \u2212 \ufffd\ni\u2208SE Qi.\n\nexceed M. This can be formulated through the following integer program:\n\n   Suppose an oracle indicates that at optimality, \ufffd\n                                                     i\u2208DS Qi \u2264 M.\n                                                                     Thus we have GS(DS) =\n\ufffd\n  i\u2208DS \u03b4i. In that case we can search among all groups of players whose total quantities does not\n\n$$\\operatorname*{max}\\sum_{i\\in S^{C}}x_{i}\\delta_{i}$$ s.t.$\\sum_{i\\in S^{C}}x_{i}Q_{i}<M$\n\n$$x_{i}\\in\\{0,1\\}\\qquad\\forall i\\in S^{C}$$\nGiven the optimal solution x\u2217 we have DS = {i : x\u2217\ni = 1}. However, the program above is the\n{0, 1}-Knapsack Problem which is NP-hard (Pisinger and Toth, 1998).\n\nProof of Lemma 3.
