        "content": "\nNegative imaginary (NI) systems theory was introduced in [1], [2] to address the robust control problem for flexible structures [3]\u2013[5], which usually have highly resonant dynamics. Roughly speaking, a square, real-rational and proper transfer function G(s) is said to be NI if it has no strict righthalf plane poles and its frequency response G(j\u03c9) satisfies j [G(j\u03c9) \u2212 G(j\u03c9)\u2217] for all \u03c9 > 0 [1]. Typical examples of NI systems are mechanical systems with colocated force actuators and position sensors. NI systems theory provides an alternative approach to the passivity theory [6] when velocity measurements are unavailable. In comparison to passivity theory, which can only deal with systems with a relative degree of zero or one, an advantage of NI systems theory is that it allows systems to have relative degree zero, one, and two [7]. An NI system can be stabilized using a strictly negative imaginary (SNI) system. Under some assumptions, the positive feedback interconnection of an NI\nsystem G(s) and an SNI system R(s) is asymptotically stable if and only if the DC loop gain of the interconnection is strictly less than unity; i.e., \u03bbmax(G(0)R(0)) < 1 (e.g., see\n[8]). NI systems theory has found its applications in many fields including nano-positioning [9]\u2013[12], control of lightly damped structures [13]\u2013[15], and control of power systems [16].\n\nNI systems theory was extended to nonlinear systems in [17]\u2013[19]. A nonlinear system is said to be NI if the system is dissipative with respect to the inner product of\n\n  This work was supported by the Australian Research Council under grant\nDP230102443.\n  K.

Under some assumptions, a nonlinear NI system\ncan be asymptotically stabilized using a nonlinear output\nstrictly negative imaginary (OSNI) system. Such a nonlinear\nextension of NI systems theory not only makes NI systems\ntheory applicable to a broader class of plants, but also allows\nthe use of more advanced controllers.\n  One such controller is the hybrid integrator-gain system\n(HIGS). HIGS elements were introduced in [20] to overcome\nthe inherent limitations of linear control systems (see e.g.,\n[21]). A HIGS switches between an integrator mode and a\ngain mode in order to have a sector-bounded input-output\nrelationship. Compared with an integrator, which has a phase\nlag of 90\u25e6, a HIGS has a similar magnitude slope but only a\n38.1\u25e6 phase lag. This 52.9\u25e6 phase reduction can significantly\nreduce time delay, and as a consequence, the overshoot; see\n[22] for a concrete example; see also [23]\u2013[26]. It is shown\nin [27] that a HIGS element is a nonlinear NI system, and\ncan be applied as a controller to asymptotically stabilize an\nNI plant. Different variants of HIGS are investigated in [28]\nand [29] to provide control methods for multi-input multi-\noutput (MIMO) NI systems and discrete-time NI systems,\nrespectively. Also, as is reported in [28], a HIGS con-\ntroller was applied to improve the performance of a MEMS\nnanopositioner in a hardware experiment. Considering the\neffectiveness of HIGS-based control and the advantages of\nHIGS elements over linear integral controllers, we may\nnaturally ask the question: rather than using a HIGS as a\nstandalone controller, can we replace integrators with HIGS\nelements in more intricate controllers to enhance control\nperformance? In this paper, we investigate this problem for\na HIGS-based integral resonant controller .\n  IRC was introduced in [30] to provide damping control for\nflexible structures. For a system with transfer matrix G(s), an\nIRC is implemented by first adding a direct feedthrough D to\nthe system G(s) and then applying an integrator in positive\nfeedback to G(s)+D. Adding such a feedthrough D changes\nthe pole-zero interlacing of G(s) into a zero-pole interlacing\nin G(s) + D. It is shown in [2], [31] that an IRC is an SNI\nsystem and can stabilize systems with the NI property. Since\nIRC are effective in damping control and easy to implement,\nthey have been widely applied in the control of NI systems;\ne.g., see [32]\u2013[34].\n  In this paper, we propose a HIGS-based IRC by replacing\nthe integrator in an IRC by a HIGS element. The advantages\nof a HIGS-based IRC are two-fold: 1) it utilizes the advan-\ntages of a HIGS in terms of small phase lag, reduced time\ndelay and reduced overshoot; 2) A HIGS has two parameters\n\n- the integrator frequency and gain value, while an integrator\nonly has one parameter \u0393. Hence, a greater degree of freedom\nin parameters is allowed in controller design using a HIGS-\nbased IRC. We provide a state-space model of a HIGS-based\nIRC. We show that a HIGS-based IRC has the nonlinear\nNI property. We also show that given a SISO NI system\nwith minimal realization, there exists a HIGS-based IRC\nsuch that their closed-loop interconnection is asymptotically\nstable. This is illustrated using an example.\n  We also investigate proportional-integral-double-integral\nresonant controllers (PII2RC) in this paper. A PII2RC is\nimplemented by replacing the integrator in an IRC by\na proportional-integral-double-integral controller with the\ntransfer function C(s) = kp + k1/s + k2/s2. We show that\na PII2RC is an SNI system and can asymptotically stabilize\nan NI plant. Then, by replacing the integrators in an PII2RC\nwith HIGS elements, we construct a HIGS-based PII2RC. We\nshow that a HIGS-based PII2RC can also provide asymptotic\nstabilization for NI plants.\n  The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\nII provides some preliminary results on negative imaginary\nsystems theory, IRC and HIGS. Section III provides a model\nfor the HIGS-based IRC and shows that it can be used in\nthe control of NI systems. Section IV introduces a PII2RC\nand also gives a stability proof for the interconnection of an\nNI system a PII2RC. Section V introduces the HIGS-based\nPII2RC and shows that it can be applied in the stabilization\nof NI systems. In Section VI, we illustrate the main results\nin this paper that are given in Section III on a mass-spring\nsystem example. The paper is concluded in Section VII.\n  Notation: The notation in this paper is standard. R denotes\nthe field of real numbers.

To be specific,\nwe consider replacing the single integrator k1/s in the\nPII2RC by a single HIGS of the form (6). Also, we replace\nthe double integrator k2/s2 by two serial cascaded HIGS,\nboth of the form (6).\n\n The HIGS H1, H2 and H3 are of the form (6), with\ndifferent parameters. We provide the system models of H1,\nH2 and H3 again in the following to distinguish different\nparameters in these three HIGS:\n\n$$\\mathcal{H}_{i}:\\begin{cases}\\dot{x}_{hi}=\\omega_{hi}e_{i},&\\text{if}(e_{i},x_{hi},e_{i})\\in\\mathcal{F}_{i1}\\\\ x_{hi}=k_{hi}e_{i},&\\text{if}(e_{i},x_{hi},e_{i})\\in\\mathcal{F}_{i2}\\end{cases}\\tag{40}$$\nwhere ei \u2208 R is the input, xhi \u2208 R is the state and also the output of the HIGS Hi (i = 1, 2, 3), respectively. Here, \u02d9ei is the time derivative of the input ei, which is assumed to be continuous and piecewise differentiable. The parameters\n\u03c9hi \u2208 [0, \u221e) and khi \u2208 (0, \u221e) represent the integrator frequency and gain value of the HIGS Hi, respectively.

(60)\nConsidering that G(0) = \u2212CA\u22121B = CY CT according to\n(2), the condition (60) can be expressed as\n\nD < \u2212G(0). (61)\nTherefore, the function W(x, xh1, xh2, xh3) given in (52) is positive definite if and only if (61) is satisfied. Taking the time derivative of W(x, xh1, xh2, xh3), we have\n\n\u02d9W(x, xh1, xh2, xh3) = xT Y \u22121 \u02d9x + 1 kh1 xh1 \u02d9xh1 + xh2 \u02d9xh2 \u2212 \u03b3( \u02d9xh1 + \u02d9xh3)Cx \u2212 \u03b3(xh1 + xh3)C \u02d9x \u2212 \u03b3D(xh1 + xh3)( \u02d9xh1 + \u02d9xh3) \u2212 kp\u03b3xT CT C \u02d9x = \ufffd xT Y \u22121 \u2212 \ufffd \u03b3(xh1 + xh3) \u2212 kp\u03b3xT CT \ufffd\ufffd C \u02d9x kh1 xh1 \u02d9xh1 \u2212 (\u03b3Cx + \u03b3D(xh1 + xh3)) \u02d9xh1 \ufffd + \ufffd 1 + [xh2 \u02d9xh2 \u2212 (\u03b3Cx + \u03b3D(xh1 + xh3)) \u02d9xh3] = \ufffd xT Y \u22121 \u2212 uC \ufffd \u02d9x + \ufffd \u02d9V1(xh1) \u2212 e \u02d9xh1 \ufffd + \ufffd \u02d9V2(xh2, xh3) \u2212 e \u02d9xh3 \ufffd . (62) We have that \ufffd xT Y \u22121 \u2212 uC \ufffd \u02d9x = \ufffd xT AT A\u2212T Y \u22121 + uBT A\u2212T Y \u22121\ufffd \u02d9x = \u02d9xT (A\u2212T Y \u22121) \u02d9x = \ufffd xT AT + uBT \ufffd A\u2212T Y \u22121 \u02d9x = 1 2 \u02d9xT (A\u2212T Y \u22121 + Y \u22121A\u22121) \u02d9x \u2264 0. (63)\nAlso, we have that \u02d9V1(xh1) \u2212 e \u02d9xh1 \u2264 0 and \u02d9V2(xh2, xh3) \u2212\ne \u02d9xh3 \u2264 0 according to the NI property of the H1 and the cascade of H2 and H3, as shown in Lemmas 3 and 5.\n\nTherefore, \u02d9W(x, xh1, xh2, xh3) \u2264 0, which implies that the closed-loop interconnection in Fig. 6 is Lyapunov stable. We apply LaSalle's invariance principle in the following to show asymptotic stability. In the case that\n\u02d9W(x, xh1, xh2, xh3)\nremains zero, we have that \u02d9xT (A\u2212T Y \u22121 + Y \u22121A\u22121) \u02d9x \u2261 0,\n\u02d9V1(xh1)\u2212e \u02d9xh1 \u2261 0 and \u02d9V2(xh2, xh3)\u2212e \u02d9xh3 \u2261 0. According to Lemma 4, \u02d9V1(xh1) \u2212 e \u02d9xh1 \u2261 0 implies\n\n$\\mathbf{x}_{h1}=\\mathbf{k}_{h1}\\mathbf{e}$. (64)\nAlso, according to Lemma 5,\n\u02d9V2(xh2, xh3) \u2212 e \u02d9xh3 \u2261 0\nimplies\n\n$$x_{h2}\\equiv k_{h2}e,\\tag{65}$$ $$x_{h3}\\equiv k_{h2}^{2}e.\\tag{66}$$\n\n$x_{h2}\\equiv k_{h2}e$ and $x_{h3}\\equiv k_{h2}^{2}e$. We show that the HIGS ${\\cal H}_{1}$, ${\\cal H}_{2}$ and ${\\cal H}_{3}$ cannot stay in the integrator mode ${\\cal F}_{i1}$ by contradiction. According to (40), if $(e_{i},x_{hi},\\dot{e}_{i})\\in{\\cal F}_{i1}$, then $\\dot{x}_{hi}=\\omega_{hi}e_{i}$. Since $x_{hi}=k_{hi}e_{i}$, then we have $k_{hi}\\dot{e}_{i}=\\omega_{hi}e_{i}$. That is,\n\n$$\\dot{e}_{i}=\\frac{\\omega_{hi}}{k_{hi}}e_{i},\\tag{67}$$\n\nwhich implies that ei diverges and so is xhi. This contradicts\nthe Lyapunov stability of the interconnection that is proved\nabove. Therefore, the HIGS H1, H2 and H3 all stay in the\ngain mode Fi2. In this case, according to (43), we have that\n\u03c9hie2\n    i > khiei \u02d9ei. That is\n\n$$\\omega_{h1}e^{2}>k_{h1}e{\\dot{e}};$$\n$$\\omega_{h2}e^{2}>k_{h2}e{\\dot{e}};$$\n\u03c9h2x2\nh2 > kh2xh2 \u02d9xh2 =\u21d2 \u03c9h2e2 > kh2e\u02d9e, for H1, H2 and H3, respectively. Hence, we have\n\n$$\\rho e^{2}>e\\dot{e},\\tag{68}$$\n\nwhere $\\rho=\\min\\{\\frac{\\omega_{11}}{k_{h1}},\\frac{\\omega_{h2}}{k_{h2}}\\}$. We show in the following that the condition (68) can be satisfied over time by satisfying $e\\dot{e}<0$. In this case that $e\\dot{e}<0$, the HIGS input $e$ converges. This implies that $x_{h1}$, $x_{h2}$ and $x_{h3}$ all converge to zero. Also, according to (49) and (51), $y$ and $u$ also converge. This is not the case of $W(x,x_{h1},x_{h2},x_{h3})\\equiv0$ that is considered here. Also, we can avoid the case that (68) is satisfied by satisfying $\\dot{e}\\equiv0$ overtime. When $e$ is a constant, the HIGS states $x_{h1}$, $x_{h2}$ and $x_{h3}$ are all constants, according to (64), (65) and (66). Also, according to (49) and (51), we have that $y=Cx$ is a constant and also $u$ is a constant. Since the system (27) is observable, we have that $\\dot{x}=0$ and the system (27) is in a steady state. Denote the constant values of $u$ and $e$ by $\\overline{u}$ and $\\overline{e}$, respectively, we have that\n\n$$\\overline{u}=(k_{h1}+k_{h2}^{2}+k_{p})\\overline{e},\\tag{69}$$\naccording to the system setting in Fig. 6. Also, we have that\n\n$$\\overline{e}=(G(0)+D)\\overline{u}.\\tag{70}$$\n\nTherefore, by choosing suitable parameters $k_{h1}$, $k_{h2}$, and $k_{p}$ such that\n\n$$k_{h1}+k_{h2}^{2}+k_{p}\\neq\\frac{1}{G(0)+D},\\tag{71}$$\nwe can avoid the case that \u02d9e \u2261 0. Hence, e\u02d9e > 0 will be satisfied eventually. In this case, since the trajectories of e and \u02d9e are independent of \u03c9h1 and \u03c9h2 when all of the HIGS are in the gain mode F2i, then we can always choose \u03c9h1 or \u03c9h2 to be sufficiently small such that \u03c1e2 <\ne\u02d9e. Therefore, \u02d9W(x, xh1, xh2, xh3) cannot remain zero over time and W(x, xh1, xh2, xh3) will keep decreasing until W(x, xh1, xh2, xh3) = 0. This implies that the interconnection in Fig. 6 is asymptotically stable.\n"
