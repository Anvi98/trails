        "content": "\nAs AI Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in practical applications across various fields, how to quickly deploy an AI agent and how to conveniently expand the application scenario of AI agents has become a challenge. Previous studies mainly focused on implementing all the reasoning capabilities of AI agents within a single LLM, which often makes the model more complex and also reduces the extensibility of AI agent functionality. In this paper, we propose CACA Agent (Capability Collaboration based AI Agent), using an open architecture inspired by service computing. CACA Agent integrates a set of collaborative capabilities to implement AI Agents, not only reducing the dependence on a single LLM, but also enhancing the extensibility of both the planning abilities and the tools available to AI agents. Utilizing the proposed system, we present a demo to illustrate the operation and the application scenario extension of CACA Agent.\n"

Consequently, researchers have implemented decision-making functions in AI Agents based on these models. By enhancing memory and tool functionalities, AI Agents are now capable of representing humans to complete various tasks. AI Agents based on LLMs have shown potential in practical applications across various fields.\n\nThe planning abilities of AI Agents are key factors affecting the quality of task handling. In some studies, AI Agents efficiently handle complex tasks by setting sub-goals and using decomposition strategies[8]. They are capable of self-reflection on past interactions with the environment, improving the quality of future decisions and actions[1][10]. However, a significant drawback of this approach is its failure to equip AI Agents with a priori factual information. This\n"

LLMs have shown great potential in tool usage capabilities[3][4] [5][6][7]. AI Agents can greatly expand their application scenarios by calling open APIs of other applications, such as using weather APIs to obtain real-time weather data and using web search APIs to access internet information, providing users with more personalized and comprehensive services. However, enabling AI Agents to quickly master the use of new tools is challenging, often requiring a significant amount of new training data and model training to achieve good results.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, we have developed a system known as the Capability Collaborative AI Agent System (CACA Agent). In this system, a series of capabilities work together to provide AI Agent functionalities to users. Firstly, we introduced Planning Capability and Methodology Capability. Planning Capability offers planning abilities based on LLMs, while Methodology Capability focuses on providing Planning Capability with factual information related to planning and the ability to interact with experts. Secondly, we have drawn on the service computing architecture by introducing Tools Capability, Tool Broker, and Tool Service into the \"Registration-Discovery-Invocation\" framework, thus supporting dynamically expand tools of AI Agents. Source codes of CACA\nAgent can be found here.1\n"

        "content": "\nPlanning capability refers to the ability to decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks. Some studies, such as Chain of Thought [8], utilize the reasoning abilities of LLMs, inspiring the models to plan and act through prompting words. However, this approach can result in 'hallucinations,' where the generated content conflicts with factual information. Methods to solve this problem include enabling models to adjust plans based on external environments\n(as in ReAct[10]) or human feedback (such as Inner Monologue[1]).\n\nNevertheless, feedback-based planning strategies are primarily suitable for simple tasks. For complex tasks, large models often need to refer to experts to find solutions.\n\nTo address these problems, we designed methodology capability to enhance planning capability. Methodology Capability enables the rapid expansion of the knowledge base concerning planning processes and provides interfaces for expert feedback, facilitating the convenient introduction of new process knowledge.\n\nThe ability to utilize tools is crucial for the functional expansion of large models and their effective interaction with the real world. Studies have demonstrated that LLMs are capable of autonomously learning tool usage through APIs (such as ToolFormer[5]), select tools from API documentation (as exemplified by Gorilla[3]), or control actual applications by connecting to RESTful APIs (like RestGPT[6]). ToolLLM[4] provides a comprehensive tool utilization framework that includes data construction, model training, and evaluation. However, these methods have limitations, such as a finite definition of tools, datasets primarily targeted at machine learning APIs, the need for data cleaning and annotation to expand tools, and an inability to meet more complex and diverse needs.\n\nTo address these issues, we drew inspiration from the concept of service computing and designed a tool capability framework based on the \"Registration-Discovery-Invocation\" Mechanism. This framework facilitates rapid expansion of tool services and leverages the inferential capabilities of LLMs for tool selection. This approach not only enhances the system's flexibility but also significantly simplifies the integration and addition of tools, making the process more efficient and convenient.\n"

        "title": "3 System Architecture 3.1 Overall System Design",
        "content": "\nThe core concept of the CACA Agent system design centers around a collaborative set of capabilities aimed at implementing AI Agents.\n\nThe CACA Agent system boasts several advantages:\n\n(1) The functionality of an AI Agent is accomplished through\nthe collaboration of a series of components, each possessing different capabilities. These components can be independently designed, implemented, deployed, and upgraded, and can be provided by different vendors.\n(2) The Methodology Capability enhances the system by enabling rapid expansion of the process knowledge base, thereby improving planning quality with clearer process insights and\nfacilitating the expansion of planning capabilities.\n(3) Inspired by service computing, a tool capability framework\nbased on the \"Registration-Discovery-Invocation\" Mechanism is designed to provide flexibility and extensibility of tools.\nOur system design is illustrated in Figure 1. A set of collaborative capabilities is introduced to implement AI Agents[9].\n\n[Action] Workflow Capability and Reception Capability are introduced to fulfill the functions of Action in the AI Agent.\n\nReception Capability primarily provides a user interface, receives user requests, and responds accordingly. Importantly, Reception Capability does not directly handle the details of user requests but converts them into structured task descriptions upon receipt, then passes the task to Workflow Capability to create a workflow instance. Once Workflow Capability completes the relevant processing steps, Reception Capability feeds back the results of the task to the user, realizing an effective user request processing workflow.\n\nWorkflow Capability is mainly used to manage workflow instances for each user request. In the CACA Agent, Workflow instances use the same template. They first interact with Planning Capability to obtain specific processing procedures, then consult Tool Capability for relevant tool information according to the needs of each operation in the process, and finally complete interface calls based on this information, eventually responding to the users with the relevant processing results.\n\n[Planning] Planning Capability and Methodology Capability work together to provide the functions of Planning in the AI Agent.\n\nPlanning Capability is primarily realized through LLMs, operating by providing a process flow for handling requests based on user queries. The Planning Capability relies on LLMs to implement the necessary reasoning abilities for planning. To ensure that the Planning Capability can deliver more accurate processing flows, and also to facilitate the convenient expansion of the AI Agent's application capabilities, it integrates domain knowledge obtained from the Methodology Capability. This integration involves breaking down complex tasks into a series of practical, feasible sub-steps, and then transmitting this task planning back to the Workflow Capability. The workflow process of the Planning Capability can be described by the following formula:\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d(*\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc66*) \u2192 [\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc471)*, . . . , \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50*(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5b)] (1)\nTo accommodate various conditions, choices, and repetitive execution needs, *\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50*(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56) is further broken down into:\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56) : (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56), \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\u210e(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56)*, \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d*(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56))\n(2)\nHere, each component has a specific function. *\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52*(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56) is responsible for directly executing each sub-task, ensuring each decomposed task unit is implemented. *\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\u210e*(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56) represents applying branching logic, choosing different execution paths based on different situations. *\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d*(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56) allows for the repetition of certain sub-tasks under specific conditions, providing a looping mechanism for scenarios requiring repeated execution of the same operation, such as batch processing or iterative optimization.\n\nMethodology Capability maintains knowledge about processing procedures for a variety of application requests across different scenarios. Simultaneously, it provides a user interface to experts, allowing them to input knowledge regarding processing procedures for specific scenarios. We propose a data structure designed to enable experts to provide and update their professional knowledge.\n\nThis data structure comprises several key components: (1) Description provides detailed background of the application scenario.\n\n(2) **ProcessSteps** is an ordered list outlining each step with title, description, and required data.(3) **DecisionPoints** specifically identifies key decision points in the process along with their decision logic. (4) **Rules** section allows experts to input specific conditions that influence the process path. (5) **Exception** section describes methods for addressing potential exceptions in the process. (6) Suggestions provides a space for experts to offer process optimization suggestions. (7) **Reference** enables uploading relevant documents for a more comprehensive explanation of the process.\n\n[Memory] Profile Capability provides the long-term memory for users. Methodology Capability possesses the knowledge of processes and Tool Capability saves the functions of various registered tools. As to the short-term memory about the processing of each user request, it is maintained by Workflow Capability.\n\nProfile Capability in the CACA Agent system is tasked with managing the configuration information the system relies on. Its main responsibility is to maintain essential information, such as the basic configuration of the system and accounts required for operations. Distinguishing between long-term and short-term memory, the Profile Capability primarily offers long-term memory. Within the CACA Agent system, short-term memory is predominantly managed by the Workflow Capability within the workflow instances for each user request.\n\n[Tool] The Tools function is facilitated through the collaborative efforts of the Tool Capability, Tool Broker, and Tool Service. Drawing inspiration from Service Computing, the CACA Agent system employs a \"Registration-Discovery-Invocation\" framework.\n\nTool Capability acts as both a tool registry and discovery center.\n\nIt handles tool registration requests from the Tool Broker, ensuring the upkeep and management of information related to various tools.\n\nAdditionally, it manages tool discovery requests from Workflow Capability, providing relevant tool information based on specific operational needs. Tool Capability utilizes the reasoning abilities of LLMs to analyze task descriptions and information on registered tools, selecting the most appropriate tool and returning information such as the relevant invocation parameters. This process is encapsulated in the following formula:\n{\ud835\udc47selected,\ud835\udc47param[input]} = DiscoverTool(\ud835\udc48req, {\ud835\udc47registered})\n(3)\nwhere \ud835\udc47*\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51* represents the selected tool, \ud835\udc47*\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a* denotes the parameters needed to invoke the tool, \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e is the user's request, and \ud835\udc47*\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51* signifies the registered tools.\n\nTool Service specifically provides relevant processing capabilities, primarily through service APIs.\n\nTool Broker acts as an intermediary for one or more Tool Services, facilitating their registration with Tool Capability, and also ensuring the validity of the services it represents through mechanisms like heartbeats. It is noteworthy that tool registration by the Tool Broker is typically manually initiated by the tool providers.\n\nAfter deploying and configuring the relevant tools, providers fill in the tool information through the interface provided by Tool Broker and initiate a tool registration request.\n"

After a user submits a request, it is initially processed by the Reception Capability, and then handed off to the Workflow Capability. The Workflow Capability subsequently queries factual data from the Profile Capability, creates a new workflow instance, and consults the Planning Capability for task execution planning. The Planning Capability, by integrating domain knowledge, divides the task into sub-steps and provides feedback to the Workflow Capability.\n\nBased on the task planning, the Workflow Capability initiates an asynchronously executed workflow. During the processing of sub-steps, it queries the Tool Capability for the most appropriate tools and parameters, generates tool invocation parameters, and then calls the tool service to complete the sub-steps. Upon completion of the workflow process, the Workflow Capability reports the execution results to the Reception Capability. Finally, the Reception Capability conveys the processed results back to the user.\n"

Upon receiving the user's query, the Workflow Capability consults the Planning Capability to devise a plan to address the request (Figure 3 (1b)). The Planning Capability then consults the Methodology Capability for methods to solve the issue (Figure 3 (1c)). Once a method is identified, it is returned to the Planning Capability, which, using this information, generates a structured workflow description with the assistance of an LLM.\n\nFor the first subtask in the workflow, the Workflow Capability queries the Profile Capability for the user's home address information (Figure 3 (1d)). For the second and third subtasks, the Workflow Capability sequentially queries the Tool Capability for available tool services (Figure 3 (1e)). At this point, several tools registered in the Tool Broker meet the subtask requirements. The Tool Capability then sends information about these tool services to the Workflow Capability. Having received this information, the Workflow Capability sequentially invokes these two tool services, thus completing the entire workflow process (Figure 3 (1f)).\n"
