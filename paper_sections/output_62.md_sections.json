The cyber insurance policy for power systems is \ntailored via cyber risk modeling, reliability impact analysis, and \ninsurance premium calculation. A stochastic Epidemic Network \nModel is developed to evaluate the cyber risk by propagating \ncyberattacks among graphical vulnerabilities. Smart technologies \ndeployed in risk modeling include smart monitoring and job thread \nassignment.

        "content": "\nT \nHE technological transformation from the conventional power grid to smart grid has been drastically galvanized by the rapid development and deployment of ICTs. With everincreasing market values in the smart grid, the mass adoption of IEDs and other cyber-capable equipment in CPSs leads to increased network connectivity and higher operation uncertainty. Various security challenges in operations may sabotage or paralyze contemporary power grids [1]-[3]. For example, configuration change attack is a common cyber-threat where IEDs receive commands to manipulate the settings. Distance relays may receive malicious commands leading to unnecessary trips to transmission lines and disruption to substation operation. To mitigate the emerging cyber-threats, diverse cybersecurity technologies have been developed. For example, transient detection algorithms and obfuscation strategy can be developed for mitigating device risks [4] and enhancing cybersecurity [5]. To protect the SCADA systems, IDS is a promising solution against potential cyberattacks. An advanced machine learning based IDS with high accuracy was developed [6]. A reinforcement learning algorithm was tailored to obtain the stochastic strategies that minimize load curtailment subjected to coordinated attacks [7]. IDS involving supervised learning should have collected raw data preprocessed and labeled for the classification purpose. An ensemble approach was developed for the comparative feature extraction [8]. Security models are in place to evaluate and defend against the cyberattacks. A Cyber-Net model was developed to capture the cyber intrusion of switching attacks in a comprehensive power CPS including firewalls, SCADA and IEDs in a substation [9]. A data-driven stochastic game model was proposed to evaluate the cross-layer security of CPSs [10]. A matrix-based model was developed to capture the cyber-physical coupling behavior of IDS [11]. Strategic competition between defense and intrusion across the temporal state transition can be described by the Markov decision process [12]. Security metrics such as TTF are proposed to gauge the long-term risk of a network [13]. Investment in the enhancement of CPSs may be beneficial to reducing the interruption costs in the face of cyberattacks. Smart monitoring based on preventive and corrective measures was proposed for cyber network of the power system [14]. Job assignment strategy was designed to boost the reliability for vehicular clouds in [15].  \n Conventionally, technological solutions are considered the main approach to mitigate cyber risks. In this work, cyberinsurance is further devised as a promising financial instrument to hedge against the emerging cyber risks. A cyber-insurance design framework typically includes cyber risk modeling, cyberattack-induced loss estimation, and insurance premium calculation. In [16], stochastic cybersecurity insurance pricing models for graphical networks was proposed.  In [17] and [18], the potential cyber-insurance models for power systems were explored. Accounting for various cyber-intrusion scenarios, the cyber-insurance designs specific to the implications of cyberthreats on power system reliability were developed. In [17], an insurance principle was developed upon the system reliability assessment at varying intrusion tolerance capabilities of the substation SCADA servers. In [18], a Bayesian Network graphical model for integrated cybersecurity-reliability was applied to a coalitional insurance design. In this work, a new mutual cyber insurance model will be developed for power grids deploying smart technologies.  \nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: \n\n- \nA novel mutual cyber-insurance framework based on the Shapley value of the cooperative game is devised.  Load loss distributions are extracted from the mutual insurance participants to formulate cost values, ultimately obtaining reduced costs in the cooperative game. \n- \nAn integrated reliability evaluation model considering substations deploying smart monitoring and job thread assignment technologies is developed aiming to enhance the system robustness against cyberattacks.  \n- \nA state-sampling cyber epidemic model is integrated into the Bayesian Network cyber vulnerability model. This integrated model is devised considering the propagation of cyberattacks and network correlation.  \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces cybersecurity in the substation CPSs coupled with the smart technologies. In Section III, the insurance principle is elaborated. Section IV presents the case studies including numerical simulations. Section V draws conclusions for this paper.  \n"

        "content": "\nTo clarify the advancement of this work, it would be beneficial to review the most relevant work. This work continues our quest for efficient cybersecurity insurance designs, following [17] and [18]. In [17], a cyber-insurance model based on estimating the cyber risk and reliability of interdependent TGs was proposed. Reference [18] presents an alternative cyberinsurance design based on the coalitional insurance platform [19]. In this work, a new cyber-insurance framework based on Shapley cooperative game is proposed to integrate the cyberinsurance model [17] into the coalitional cyber-insurance model [18]. A prototypical epidemic spreading model [16] was used to explore the upper and lower bounds of cyberattack infection probabilities. \n\nThe proposed cyber epidemic model inspired by [16] is conceived to further estimate the long-term infectious vulnerability risk on the graphical cyber epidemic network model coupled with power systems. While the epidemic model in [16] may be effective in estimating the upper bounds of infection probabilities in various scenarios, explicit mathematical form to evaluate the physical and monetary losses incurred in CPSs by the cyberattack needs to be further developed. The proposed epidemic network model is thus specifically tailored to the reliability-based load curtailment estimation. This study examines the effectiveness of the proposed epidemic network model considering smart technologies including smart monitoring [14] and job thread assignment [15] for improving the reliability of TGs. The results of reliability assessment are further integrated in the proposed insurance premium design. Shapley value is utilized in the proposed insurance premium design in the proposed insurance premium design as a unique solution of the cooperative game which optimizes the price of anarchy [20]-[22]. The interdependence of CPSs was addressed in [23] by creating the probability table without explicitly assigning the SoI. In this work, the SoI are directly incorporated into the state sampling process which are then reflected in load loss profiles of TGs. The comparison with the related work described above is summarized in Table I.  \n\n \nTABLE I SUMMARY OF COMPARISON WITH RELATED WORK \n[18] \n[17] \n[19] \n[14] \n[15] \n[16] \n[23] \n \nThis work \nRA \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n \n\u2713 \n\n\nCPE \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n\n\n\u2713 \n \nSM \n\u2713 \n\n\n\u2713 \n\n\nJA \n\u2713 \n\n\n\u2713 \n \n \nSCG \n\u2713 \n\n\nMI \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n \n\u2713 \n\n\nLI \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n\n\n\u2713 \nCSM \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n \n \n\u2713 \n \n \nGCVN \n\u2713 \n\u2713 \n\n\nCEM \n\u2713 \n\n\n\u2713 \n \n\n* RA = Reliability Assessment, CPE = Cyber Premium Evaluation, SM = Smart Monitoring, JA = Job Assignment, SCG = Shapley Cooperative Game, MI = Mutual Insurance, LI = Loss Interdependence, CSM = Cyber-Security Metric, GCVN = Graphical Cyber Vulnerability Network, CEM = Cyber Epidemic Model \n"

        "content": "\nFig. 2 illustrates the attack graph of the proposed ENM. The vulnerability \ud835\udc63\u210e is denoted as a colored oval VUL. Each node represents a vulnerability. In the proposed ENM, two types of anomalies, ROB and DoS, are considered. ROB attack decrypts the control center's server privilege by iterating queries to a control server. DoS attack on the substation server is triggered by unauthenticated clients issuing specially crafted messages. \n\nThe successful exploitation condition of vulnerability \ud835\udc63\u210e occurs when the server privilege is obtained by the attacker, denoted as \n\ud835\udc50\u210e. \n\nVulnerability scores are determined by CVSS comprising the base score, temporal score, and environmental score that take a wide range of attack-related factors into account, including confidentiality, integrity, availability, attack complexity, privileges required, and exploit code maturity [24]. \n\nIn Fig. 2, the attacker may compromise the substation \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5e,1 to start the attack on the q-th TG. Specifically, the attacker deploys anomaly DoS(1) to gain access to the server privilege user(1) of \n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5e,1 by exploiting <0, 1>. Once \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5e,1 is compromised, adjacent \n<1, 2> of the control center \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5e can be exploited in a similar manner. Vulnerabilities in cascade are exploited sequentially. In \n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5e, the substations and the control center are laid out according to cyber connections in the attack graph. Power dispatching action is feasible along the good routes connecting healthy nodes. Then the good routes are obtained using a routing algorithm such as Depth-First Search [25]. The substations outside of the good routes indicate disconnection from power generation capacity, resulting in load curtailment in the TG. More details can be referred to [26] for cyber network modeling.    \nPhysically, exploiting the vulnerability means the attacker breaches the server firewall to gain the server privilege to manipulatively command the substation. According to the attack graph, all preceding and current vulnerabilities should be exploited to compromise a substation server. However, since the substations located at any point of the attack graph may be compromised, an external infection term is established in the Cyber Epidemic Model to include such a possibility. After the substation server is compromised, the attacker may send counterfeit commands to the protective relays to disconnect the major substation IED from grid operations.  \nThe reliability-driven approach adopted in this study is different from contingency analysis on cascading failures. A graphical S-k contingency analysis based on extended enumeration considers the cascading failure by gradually removing the overloaded lines [27]. Worst cases with divergent load flow results are recorded to estimate the substation risk indices. Differently, in the MCS based reliability evaluation procedure, each component status is determined by comparing the random number generated and the FOR of that component. Then, a reliability-based OPF is performed for the sampled state to decide if there is load loss after re-dispatching the power to minimize the overall load loss based on the current system state. Finally, the overall reliability indices can be calculated by sampling enough system states with varying failure scenarios. \n\n \n\n_Definition I:_ Substation Compromise Time\n\n$$T_{c}=\\frac{\\Sigma v_{h}\\epsilon\\nu\\,t_{s}(v_{h})p(v_{h}\\wedge c_{h})}{p(c_{h})}\\tag{1A}$$\nJob Assignment:               \n\n$$t_{s}(v_{h})=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}t_{s}(J_{1},\\lambda,\\mu)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\\\ t_{s}(J_{2},\\lambda,\\mu)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}+\\frac{1}{2\\lambda(1-p_{1})}\\\\ t_{s}(J_{3},\\lambda,\\mu)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}+\\frac{1}{2\\lambda(1-p_{1})}+\\frac{1}{3\\lambda(1-p_{1})(1-p_{2})}\\\\ p_{1}=\\Pr[Y_{1}>U]=\\mu+\\lambda\\\\ p_{2}=\\Pr[\\min\\left\\{Y_{1},Y_{2}\\right\\}>U]=\\mu+2\\lambda\\end{array}\\right.\\tag{10}$$\nSmart Monitoring: \n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}{{(\\lambda_{c},\\mu_{c})=(\\sum_{i=0}^{N}\\lambda_{i}\\,,\\frac{\\lambda_{c}*P u_{P}}{1-P u_{P}})}}\\\\ {{\\left\\{P_{U P b}=\\frac{\\mu_{b}}{\\mu_{b}+\\lambda_{b}}<P_{U P}=\\frac{\\mu_{c}}{\\mu_{c}+\\lambda_{c}}\\right.}}\\\\ {{\\left.\\begin{array}{c}{{\\mu_{b}=\\mu_{0}}}\\\\ {{\\mu_{b}\\leq\\mu_{i},1\\leq i\\leq N}}\\\\ {{\\lambda_{b}=\\sum_{i=0}^{N+M}\\lambda_{i}}\\end{array}\\right.}}\\end{array}\\tag{1E}$$\n{  \nEpidemic Network Model:  \n\n$p(v_{h})=\\frac{\\zeta(v_{h})}{10}$ (1F) $U(0.8,1)$ + $1_{(c_{h}=T)},h=1$\n     \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc50\u210e|\ud835\udc63\u210e) = {\n\n$p(c_{h}|v_{h}\\wedge(v_{1}\\vee\\ldots\\vee v_{h-1})),n\\geq h\\geq2$ (1G) $p(v_{h}\\wedge c_{h})=p(v_{h})*p(c_{h}|v_{h})$ (1H) $p(c_{h})=\\sum_{l=1}^{n}p(v_{l}\\wedge c_{h})$ (1I) **Subject to:**\n A security metric used extensively in reliability assessment is the SCT \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50.

Considering the attack graph, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 is logically synthesized with a Bayesian Network [13]. \n\nThe SCT \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 is synthesized based on the individual sojourn times \n\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 of the vulnerabilities \ud835\udc63\u210e. \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 is positively correlated to \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 and the overall system reliability. The smart technologies considered in this work including smart monitoring [14] and job thread assignment [15]. In the job assignment, \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 corresponds to the memory thread resource in the cyber-physical elements assigned to the operational task. In smart monitoring, the CPS elements deploy preventive and corrective measures to boost substation security. The probability of exploiting vulnerability \ud835\udc63\u210e depends on its score \ud835\udf0d(\ud835\udc63\u210e).

The cyber epidemic model that infects a vulnerability node may stochastically spread to an adjacent vulnerability node set \u03b6. State sequence of a specific substation is determined by the infection time vector \ud835\udc47\u20d1 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 and recovery time vector \ud835\udc47\u20d1 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50 based on the SCTs of \u03b6 and binomially distributed recovery times of \u03b6. To consider the cyber risks spreading in the large-scale network, external epidemic infection time \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 and recovery time \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 are respectively included in augmented \ud835\udc47\u20d1 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc47\u20d1 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50. The intensity of the epidemic attack can be adjusted by the basic reproduction number \ud835\udf00 and graphical edge coupling number \ud835\udc50. The substation infection time \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 and recovery time \n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50 are estimated by the maximum and expected values of the respective vectors. The probability of cyberattack infection \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58 \nis calculated using \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50. Then \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58 is compared with a uniform variate to determine whether the substation server is compromised by the cyberattack. The proposed Epidemic Network Model concerns a software-based cyberattack whose impacts would be reflected in the physical power system. When the substations become infected, their operations are compromised. Specifically, the physical loss due to the cyberattack is measured by load curtailment in the reliability analysis. The economic implication of the load loss on TGs is then evaluated in the insurance premium design. \n\nOptimization 1: Reliability-based Load Curtailment Estimation  \n \nmin {\u2211 \ud835\udc72\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc65\n}\ud835\udf08                                (3A)  \nSubject to: \n\n\ud835\udc69\ud835\udf3d + \ud835\udc6e + \ud835\udc72\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91                      ****                      (3B) \n|\ud835\udc6d| \u2264 \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91                                       (3C) \n\ud835\udfce \u2264 \ud835\udc72\ud835\udc99 \u2264 \ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91                            (3D) \n\ud835\udfce \u2264 \ud835\udc6e \u2264 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41(\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc99) \u2217 \ud835\udc6e\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91                    (3E) \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41(\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc99) = \ud835\udfcf{\u2119\ud835\udc63\u2265\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58}                           ****                           (3F) \nThe substation state sequence \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41(\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc99) is sampled subject to cyber epidemic described in *Definition 2*, with binary values 1 \nand 0 indicating the generation capacity \ud835\udc6e\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91 connected to the specific substations to be either available or offline. If the substation server is infected by the cyberattack, the attacker could breach the server root privilege and send false tripping commands to the substation relays that cause generation offline. \n\nIn *Optimization 1*, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41(\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc99) \u2217 \ud835\udc6e\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91 determines the upper bounds of online capacity \ud835\udc6e at each time step \ud835\udf08. Together with the load capacity \ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91 and thermal limit constraints \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91, the aggregate substation load loss \u2211 \ud835\udc72\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc65\n is minimized at each time step \ud835\udf08. The energy balance between the online generation supply and online load demand should always be maintained with load curtailment \n\ud835\udc72\ud835\udc99 being further bounded by the load capacity \ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91.    \n\n\nFig. 3 depicts a typical process of epidemic propagation on a substation. The malicious attacker infiltrates the firewall of the control center through remote access network connected via a modem. If the Ethernet in the control center is breached, the attacker can gain access to the data storage, application server and operation of the workstation. Since WAP controls the substation operation via RTUs, the attacker may directly compromise the substation through the WAP without going through control center. Through infecting the network switch with malware, the attacker may further compromise the substation Intranet.  That is, the attacker obtains the privilege of the SCADA server, Human-Machine Interface and the WAP. If the WAP is hacked, false commands can be sent to RTUs to modify the trip settings in different relays. The breaker operating units connected to RTUs coordinate the relays to provide overcurrent protection, overvoltage protection and differential protection. By intentionally reducing the threshold value of the overcurrent relay, the circuit breakers can be falsely tripped when no physical fault condition is presented. A detailed survey further analyzed the impacts of various cyberattack scenarios in the power systems [28].   \n \nIn the following subsection, the cyber-physical enhancement \n"

        "content": "\nTo enhance power system reliability, substation-oriented smart monitoring including SCADA systems and EMU may be worth investments. To highlight the merit of the cyber-physical smart grid with sensing and remedial equipment, reliability modeling of the smart monitoring devices performed in Fig. 4(a) shows a base case of two-state reliability model with failure rate and repair rate (\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc4f). In Fig. 4(a), the smart monitoring reliability model has M+1 up states ( \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5d0~\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc40 ) and N+1 \n(\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5b0~\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc41 ) down states, with failure rate and repair rates \n(\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc56) among respective states. The smart monitoring model can be reduced to an equivalent composite two-state model with the composite failure rate and repair rate (\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc50) [14].  \nFor the substation servers, it is crucial to ensure IEDs within the substations with computing capability function normally. In typical operations of computing systems, portions of the memory are dynamically allocated to process-specific tasks. The scheduling strategies in [15] can be adapted to enable improved job thread assignment for our problem. Multiple server threads are scheduled to carry out the same task command of IEDs to heighten the computing dependability against uncertainties. \n\nFig. 4(b) shows a basic 2-thread (\ud835\udc3d2) fault-tolerant job thread assignment procedure assigned with a critical server task in the substation SCADA server. The procedure includes total 4 states: both threads *T1T2* carrying out single task, either thread (T1, T2) executing the same task, and the task is terminated when both threads fail F to perform the task. Similarly, Fig. 4(b) also shows a 3-thread (\ud835\udc3d3) fault-tolerant job thread assignment procedure with 11 states: all 3 threads *T1T2T3* conducting single task, 2 of the threads (*T1T2, T1T3, T2T3*) carrying out the same task, within 2 selected threads one of the threads further fails (C1~C6), and the task is terminated when all 3 threads fail F to perform the task. The sojourn time of \ud835\udc3d2 and \ud835\udc3d3 are \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc3d2, \ud835\udf07, \ud835\udf06) \nand \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc3d3, \ud835\udf07, \ud835\udf06) , determined by the probabilities of state transition, duration of task operation, expected thread recruitment rate \ud835\udf07 and thread residence rate \ud835\udf06. In this study, duration of the task operation and residual time of the job thread executing the task are assumed to be exponentially distributed for simplicity. \n\nIt will be shown in the case studies the combined application of job thread assignment and smart monitoring can achieve improved grid reliability.  \n"

VaR is the 100\ud835\udf1b% percentile of the loss \u2112. TCE is the average of the worst 100\ud835\udf1b% scenarios of the loss \u2112. Given the same level of \ud835\udf1b, TCE is always larger than VaR. The relations among VaR, TCE and the loss \u2112  are described in (7). \n\nTCE premium design \ud835\udf0b1 [17] is a mutual insurance allocated from the insured TGs. \ud835\udf0b1 can gauge risk conservatively based on individual contributions to \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc38\ud835\udf1b(\u2211 \u2112\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udc5e\n) .

Given the subset \ud835\udc46 including the selected TGs, Shapley cost of the q-th TG when \ud835\udc58 TG(s) submit the claim is denoted as  \n\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc46). The Shapley cost \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc46)  handles typical risk lower than the tail risk when the cumulative loss distributions \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc5e  are smaller than  \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc45\ud835\udf1b(\u2112\ud835\udc5e), \ud835\udc5e \u2208 \ud835\udc46. Since the typical risk in each TG varies with \ud835\udc58 , the probability that the specific TGs are included in a subset \ud835\udc46 is determined by an unfair coin-tossing model in \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc5e . The cooperative game \ud835\udc3a  determines each \u2102\ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc48, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc58) by assigning the expected values of its marginal contribution.

In other words, the Shapley cooperative game \ud835\udc3a guarantees   \n"

Besides, \ud835\udf0b3 is a mutual insurance that intends to be a financial mutual trust. Most TGs with positive risk loading provide some margin to cushion against uncertainty. In the mutual insurance, outliers struck by unexpectedly high damages would result in negative risk loading. Losses of other TGs could partially be covered by the mutual insurance premium. \n\nA major design goal of the insurance premium is to mitigate the risk insolvency by restraining the risk higher than the indemnity. TCE premium \ud835\udf0b1 offers good mitigation on the risk insolvency and serves as the claim term in \ud835\udf0b3. The nature of mutual insurance guarantees \ud835\udf0b3 premium package is nearly as affordable as  \ud835\udf0b2. Combining the advantages of \ud835\udf0b1 and \ud835\udf0b2, the proposed \ud835\udf0b3  can substantially restrain the insolvency comparable to  \ud835\udf0b1. The mutual insurance premium estimation procedure is summarized in **Algorithm 1**.         \nThe proposed cybersecurity mutual insurance model shown in Fig. 5 can be elaborated as follows: (1) Epidemic cyberphysical system model introduced in Section II. The cyber attacker injects the epidemic virus through Internet that penetrates the firewall of a TG. Within the TG, a control center and substations interconnected via the Local Area Network (LAN) are stochastically infected by the cyber epidemic. The proposed cyber-physical network model (*Definition 1*) accounts for the defensive capability of the TG via the hardware investment, software strategy development and its intrinsic vulnerabilities. With the above information, the substation state sequence (*Definition 2*) can be synthesized considering the SoI across the TGs. \n\n(2) Cyber-insurance design introduced in Section III. \n\nTaking the state sequence generated by the cyber epidemic, load curtailment of the respective TGs is calculated with the reliability analysis (*Optimization 1*). Using the marginal distribution of load loss statistics, the proposed Shapley premium of the individual TGs are estimated. In the following section, the proposed Shapley premium design at various SoI \nand cyber-physical defense investment will be verified in the simulated case studies.  \n"

        "content": "\nCase studies are performed to validate the proposed reliability assessment framework and cyber insurance model. As shown in Fig. 6, a benchmark IEEE RTS-GMLC is deployed [29]. The IEEE RTS-GMLC incorporates the increasing share of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar energies. To study the effectiveness of mutual insurance, the 3-area test system are divided into 5 TGs. The IEEE RTS-GMLC is further augmented by incorporating the epidemic cyberattack model. The cyberattack parameters of the epidemic network are assigned as follows: \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 = 2000 hrs, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 = 4 hrs, \ud835\udf00 = 2, and \n\ud835\udc50 = 0.8. \n\nA preliminary comparison is made on the system risk in the \n\ntest system under various scenarios. Risk indices estimating load curtailment and fault coverage are adopted from [30]. Denote $LC$ as the load curtailment and $FC$ as the count of faulty buses at the $m$-th time step. The Expected $LC$ and $FC$ are defined as follows:\n\n$$ELC=\\frac{1}{N_{m}}\\sum_{m=1}^{N_{m}}LC_{m}^{T}\\tag{10}$$\n\n$$EFC=\\frac{1}{N_{m}}\\sum_{m=1}^{N_{m}}FC_{m}^{T}\\tag{11}$$\n\nParameters of the cyber-physical elements installed in the \nsubstations are listed in Table II. When the substation's smart monitoring is functional, the server is connected to other elements. Otherwise, the server is disconnected from other elements. Six scenarios are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the job assignment and smart monitoring. As shown in Table III, the deployment of job assignment and smart monitoring technologies effectively reduces the ELC and EFC. Reduced ELC and EFC indicate enhanced security and reliability of power supply. The job assignment facilitates Scenario 2 with 20% improvement from Scenario 1 in both ELC and EFC. With the smart monitoring technology enforced, Scenario 4 improves 7% on ELC and EFC over Scenario 1. In Scenarios 5 and 6, smart monitoring plus the job assignment can further improve several percent from Scenarios 2 and 3 with job assignment alone. \n\n \n\nTABLE II CYBER-PHYSICAL ELEMENT PARAMETERS \nElement \nFailure rate \nRepair rate \nReliability \nState \n\ud835\udf06(\u210e\u22121) \n\ud835\udf07(\u210e\u22121) \nServer \n1/9200 \n1/48 \n0.9948 \n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4f \n(Attacked)  \nServer \n1/14000 \n1/48 \n0.9966 \n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5b0 \nBus \n1/876000 \n1/6 \n0.999993 \n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5b1 \nSwitch \n1/45000 \n1/48 \n0.9989 \n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5b2 \nOptical fiber \n1/500000 \n1/12 \n0.999976 \n\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5d1 \nEMU \n1/87600 \n1/24 \n0.9997 \n\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5d2 \n \nTABLE III RELIABILITY-ASSESSMENT RESULTS OF EXAMPLE SCENARIOS \nScenarios \nELC (p.u.) \nImprovement \nEFC \nImprovement \n1 \n(\ud835\udc3d1, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc4f,\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc4f) \n0.2398 \n-- \n12.915 \n-- \n2 \n(\ud835\udc3d2,\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc4f) \n0.1852 \n22.77% \n9.9233 \n23.17% \n3 \n(\ud835\udc3d3,\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc4f) \n0.1471 \n38.66% \n7.7812 \n39.75% \n4 \n(\ud835\udc3d1, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc50) \n0.2212 \n7.66% \n11.930 \n7.63% \n5 \n(\ud835\udc3d2, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc50) \n0.1693 \n29.40% \n9.0138 \n30.21% \n6 \n(\ud835\udc3d3, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc50) \n0.1334 \n44.37% \n7.0239 \n45.62% \n\n \nThe reliability-based OPF is carried out in MCS based on the state sampling method. The sampled period is 40 years with hourly time steps. The server smart technology deployment within the substations determines the SCT. Cyberattacks that penetrate the substation servers may disturb the grid operation by sending spurious commands to disconnect generation from the grid, causing physical load losses. The load loss statistics is then converted into the monetary reliability worth to estimate the cybersecurity insurance premiums.  \nTo highlight the merits of the proposed Shapley premium design, two case groups are created to compare job thread assignment, smart monitoring, and correlation coefficients at varying degrees. Case Group \n1: \nBased on Scenario \n1  \n(\ud835\udc3d1, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc4f) where in the substation only a single job thread is available without smart monitoring.  \nCase Group \n2: \nBased on Scenario \n6  \n(\ud835\udc3d3, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc50)where the strongest job assignment and substation smart monitoring are enforced. To explore the loss characteristics in Case Group 1, Table IV summarizes the expected values, Standard Deviations, and Coefficients of Variation under various strengths of correlation \ud835\udc5f. CoV is obtained from the SD being divided by the expected value. The expected values come close to SDs, resulting in CoVs only fluctuating in a small range of [0.74 1.13].

In Case Group 2, the incentive of investing on cyber-physical enhancement can be observed from Table V that expected losses are reduced substantially and reduction of SDs occurs to a lesser extent, with CoVs lying in [0.88 1.33].  \nIn Fig. 7, the sampled SoI among the TGs are demonstrated in the Pearson correlation matrix. The correlation is symmetric and correlation between each of the two TGs can be observed in the off-diagonal entries. Fig. 8(a) depicts the correlation matrix of the Case Group 1. When \ud835\udc5f = 0, the SoI across the TGs are close to 0 with higher correlations between the neighboring TGs in the same areas. The correlations range around 0.45 as \ud835\udc5f increases to 0.5. When \ud835\udc5f = 1, the correlations across all TGs are above 0.9. The correlation matrix in Case Group 2 is as shown in Fig. 8(b). Due to reduced load losses, the correlations are in general weakened between the same pair of TGs in Case Group 1.      \nInsurance premiums are designed to prepare TGs for catastrophic losses induced by probable cyberattack events. For interconnected TGs, mutual insurance accounting for respective marginal loss statistics would be a sensible option. The premium with a high-risk loading offers solid indemnity, which may however be less financially appealing to potential participants. An ideal premium design should be meticulously formulated to avoid excessive financial burdens while providing sufficient loss indemnities for the insured parties. The highly infectious nature of the cyber epidemic model dictates a heavily skewed tail risk. \n\nTo validate the design of the proposed cyber-insurance principle, herein (a) TCE premium \ud835\udf0b1, (b) Coalitional premium \ud835\udf0b2, and (c) Shapley premium \ud835\udf0b3 of this study are compared at various degrees of correlation of the TGs. The TCE Premium is the most conservative design predominantly responsive to the tail risk, providing great redundancy at the cost of high-risk loading. On the contrary, the Coalitional Premium is the most affordable package by excluding extreme high-loss events with low probabilities. The Shapley Premium is cooperative and tailored to add further coverage against the tail risk, striking a balance between the affordability and loss coverage. To gauge the relative premium burden against the expected risk, RLC is defined as follows:  \n\ud835\udf0c(\u2112\ud835\udc5e) = \ud835\udf0b(\u2112\ud835\udc5e)/\ud835\udc38[\u2112\ud835\udc5e] \u2212 1                    (12) \nwhere \ud835\udf0c(\u2112\ud835\udc5e) should be generally positive to gather sufficiency budget for loss coverage. While positive RLC is preferable against the unexpected extreme risk, excessively high RLC would discourage the TGs from insurance participation.  \nIn [17], the indemnities of \ud835\udf0b1(\u2112\ud835\udc5e) are not clearly specified \n\nsince the original design is tailored to a third-party insurer. In this paper, all premium designs are assumed to be mutual insurance. All participating entities are both insurers and insureds. For the sake of brevity, the indementies of $\\pi_{1}\\big{(}\\mathcal{L}_{q}\\big{)}$ are proportionally allocated based on $\\Gamma_{q}^{\\psi}(\\pi_{2})$:\n\n$$\\Gamma_{q}^{\\psi}(\\pi_{1})=\\sum_{q}\\pi_{1}\\big{(}\\mathcal{L}_{q}\\big{)}*\\frac{\\Gamma_{q}^{\\psi}(\\pi_{2})}{\\sum_{q}\\Gamma_{q}^{\\psi}(\\pi_{2})}\\tag{13}$$\n\nIn Tables VI and VII, $\\pi_{1}$, $\\pi_{2}$, and $\\pi_{3}$ are evaluated based on \nthe loss statistics extracted from the two case groups with heavy tail risks. Characteristics of each design will be further elaborated numerically as follows. \n\nThe premiums of Case Group 1 are shown in Table VI. In each TG, \ud835\udf0b1, \ud835\udf0b2, and \ud835\udf0b3 are positively correlated with the strength of correlation \ud835\udc5f. \ud835\udf0b1 has the most conservative payment schedule and can be financially burdensome. \ud835\udf0b1  may penalize the participants with heavy risk loading when extreme catastrophic events do not happen. Cost-effectiveness of \ud835\udf0b1 is unacceptably low because the maximum of \ud835\udf0c1 exceeds 3. On the flip side, \ud835\udf0b2 \nis an entry-level premium design devised to be the most affordable and evenly distributed package across the TGs.  \ud835\udf0b2 \noffers small indemnities and the premiums collected from the TGs. \n\n\ud835\udc5f = 0 \nTG1 \nTG2 \nTG3 \nTG4 \nTG5 \n\ud835\udf0b1 \n19.0 \n20.3 \n11.3 \n12.6 \n12.6 \n\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf0b1)    \n15.3 \n18.8 \n13.1 \n14.1 \n14.6 \n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0c1 \n3.30 \n1.87 \n3.11 \n2.60 \n2.22 \n\ud835\udf0b2 \n4.93 \n6.51 \n4.35 \n4.78 \n5.07 \n\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf0b2)  \n8.74 \n10.7 \n7.49 \n8.04 \n8.36 \n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0c2 \n0.12 \n-0.08 \n0.58 \n0.37 \n0.29 \n\ud835\udf0b3 \n4.06 \n7.97 \n3.25 \n4.92 \n5.91 \n\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf0b3) \n17.0 \n18.1 \n10.1 \n11.2 \n11.3 \n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0c3 \n-0.08 \n0.12 \n0.18 \n0.41 \n0.51 \n\ud835\udc5f = 0.5 \nTG1 \nTG2 \nTG3 \nTG4 \nTG5 \n\ud835\udf0b1 \n19.9 \n40.7 \n12.3 \n13.5 \n12.8 \n\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf0b1)    \n19.0 \n26.5 \n17.7 \n17.8 \n18.2 \n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0c1 \n3.32 \n3.14 \n2.37 \n2.57 \n2.19 \n\ud835\udf0b2 \n5.33 \n7.37 \n5.28 \n5.26 \n5.48 \n\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf0b2)  \n9.93 \n13.8 \n9.22 \n9.31 \n9.49 \n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0c2 \n0.16 \n-0.25 \n0.44 \n0.39 \n0.36 \n\ud835\udf0b3 \n4.39 \n8.26 \n6.47 \n5.99 \n6.81 \n\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf0b3) \n11.6 \n23.7 \n7.17 \n7.85 \n7.46 \n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0c3 \n-0.05 \n-0.16 \n0.77 \n0.58 \n0.69 \n\ud835\udc5f = 1 \nTG1 \nTG2 \nTG3 \nTG4 \nTG5 \n\ud835\udf0b1 \n20.5 \n40.8 \n12.5 \n13.9 \n17.9 \n\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf0b1)    \n21.8 \n27.9 \n17.8 \n18.7 \n19.3 \n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0c1 \n1.75 \n2.20 \n2.14 \n1.94 \n2.39 \n\ud835\udf0b2 \n7.55 \n9.39 \n6.03 \n6.40 \n6.44 \n\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf0b2)  \n14.1 \n18.1 \n11.5 \n12.1 \n12.5 \n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0c2 \n0.01 \n-0.26 \n0.52 \n0.35 \n0.22 \n\ud835\udf0b3 \n9.85 \n10.9 \n7.21 \n8.28 \n6.86 \n\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf0b3) \n16.2 \n32.2 \n9.84 \n11.0 \n14.2 \n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0c3 \n0.32 \n-0.15 \n0.81 \n0.75 \n0.30 \n"

By contrast, \ud835\udf0c3 is dispersed in [-0.16 0.81], a typical range of risk loading. \ud835\udf0b3 offers a wider margin in risk loading than \ud835\udf0b2  to guarantee sufficient budget to cover individual risk.   \nIn Table VII, risk loading in Case Group 2 generally increase due to the enhanced security measure that reduces tail risk profile.  \ud835\udf0c1 has a maximum close to 4 and could be too high to motivate entities to participate in. \ud835\udf0b2  is evenly distributed against average risk, with \ud835\udf0c2 lying in [-0.24 0.72]. \ud835\udf0b3 renders ideal risk loading \ud835\udf0c3  to rarely exceed 1. High capacity of indemnity and low risk loading make the proposed \ud835\udf0b3  a potentially compelling insurance model in practice.  \nThe probability of insolvency \u03a6(\ud835\udf0b) is another risk measure which quantifies the capability of the insurance to mitigate the insolvency. \u03a6(\ud835\udf0b) is defined as the probability that the loss is greater than the indemnity: \n \n\n$$\\Phi(\\pi)=\\Pr[{\\cal L}_{q}>\\Gamma_{q}^{\\Psi}(\\pi)]\\tag{14}$$\n\nAs shown in Table VIII, in Case Group 1, $\\pi_{1}$ generally $\\pi_{1}$ has the best $\\pi_{1}$ and $\\pi_{2}$ are all $\\pi_{1}$ and $\\pi_{2}$.\n\nprovides the best insolvency alleviation with lowest probabilities of insolvency. In fact, \ud835\udf0b1 is such a conversative premium design against risk that the insolvency in some cases is 0. While \ud835\udf0b3 leads to the insolvency being lower than \ud835\udf0b2 and greater than \ud835\udf0b1, \n\ud835\udf0b3 has the affordability superior to \ud835\udf0b1. In Case Group 2, when the cyber risk is significantly reduced, \ud835\udf0b3  can restrain the insolvency to be about as low as that of \ud835\udf0b1.  Thus, \ud835\udf0b3 offers an economical option with relatively sufficient insolvency mitigation.  \n"

        "content": "\nIn this paper, a mutual insurance premium principle is designed to fairly share cyber risks across the participating TGs and control the overall insolvency risk. This study is among the first endeavors to approach the cyber-insurance by estimating the insolvency. In the case studies, it is shown the smart monitoring and job thread assignment solutions can work standalone or together to boost the reliability of TGs. Reduced insolvency probability is offered by the proposed Shapley premium while remaining as affordable as the coalitional premium. More challenges may occur when real-life variables are factored in. Since any two power system servers are to some extent connectable from each other, establishing the topology of cyber node connections could be complicated. Selecting weights to prioritize the crucial edges in the cyber node graph could be essential. There are also challenges on the actuarial end. First, accurate cyber risk estimation for specific systems would rely on long-term historical data set collection. How much risk loading a premium design reserved should be sufficient against tail risk is still left to further exploration. Second, the proposed Shapley insurance scheme is designed to achieve two goals: insolvency risk control and fair distribution of indemnity. Although these goals are achieved most of the time, there are exceptions especially when some participants are struck by unexpectedly high losses due to inadequate self-protection. This shall motivate future work in designing more insurance schemes to reflect selfprotection level and thus incentivize cyber-security investment. \n"
