INTRODUCTION\nR\nECONFIGURABLE Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have attracted considerable attention in recent years. This technique is considered as an emerging technology for the next generation of wireless communications due to its potential to improve coverage and energy efficiency in wireless networks [1], [2], [3]. Unlike conventional reflectors or antennas, a RIS comprises multiple unit cells capable of dynamically altering their electromagnetic properties for different incoming waves. This enables RIS to actively control, redirect, and enhance electromagnetic waves in desired directions.\n\nThe electromagnetic (EM) perspective of the RIS-related research has been addressed in Part I of this paper. The communication aspects, discussed in this part, focus on path loss and channel modeling for RIS-aided wireless communications.

In [4], [5], the authors demonstrated the scaling law governing the power reflected from a RIS is influenced by various factors, such as the RIS size and the mutual distances between the RIS and the transmitter/receiver with measurements. The authors of [6] give an overview of RIS-based channel measurements and experiments, large-scale path loss models, and small-scale multipath fading channel models, as well as channel characterization issues of RIS-assisted wireless communication systems. In [7], the authors introduce a macroscopic model for evaluating the multi-mode re-radiation and diffuse scattering from a RIS. That model can be integrated with ray-based models such as ray tracing and ray launching for realistic radio propagation simulations. In addition, the authors in [8] extend the model to include metasurface scattering at the beginning or at the end of the interaction chain and perform ray tracing simulations in an indoor scenario for a lossy, phase-gradient anomalous reflector (AR). The RIS-tailored Vienna systemlevel simulator (SLS) [9] with a MATLAB ray tracer interface, as well as path loss models for system-level simulations have been introduced in [10], [11]. In [12], the authors evaluate the system performance of a RIS-assisted cellular network through system-level simulations, such as the outdoor and indoor coverage and ergodic rate with different-sized RISs and under different frequency bands.\n\nEven though a broad range of RIS-related research activities have been done in recent years, there is still a lack of a systematic study of RIS from the EM design to communication models. The above mentioned models are based on the notion of the local reflection coefficient from different points of the RIS panels, but this field model is not necessarily efficient or even electromagnetically consistent, and in practice it is not possible to independently control the response of each individual array element. In addition, there are no works on analyzing a realistic RIS in a ray tracer or in a system-level simulator. It is essential to build connections between the theory and practice, as well as between the EM design part and the communication analysis part.\n\nTo fill the gap, in this work, we systematically study the communication link performance of a RIS that is designed based on the EM theory of array scattering synthesis methodology [13]. We define the appropriate controllable parameters of RIS panels and next analyze the large-scale fading of the designed RIS through the Vienna SLS and with EM simulation results. Moreover, we integrate the designed RIS into a ray tracer to compare the ray tracing simulation results with the theoretical outcomes. Finally, we execute measurements using a manufactured AR prototype and compare the experimental results with theoretical analysis and ray tracing simulations. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work that systematically studies a RIS from the EM design to the systemlevel and ray tracing simulations, then to model validation by prototype manufacturing and link measurements. This is also the first work on implementing a perfectly designed RIS and a realistic lossy AR to different ray tracers with the performance verified through theory.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces two methods of large-scale fading analysis and compares the results. Section III explains the RIS modeling in a ray tracer and compares the ray tracing simulation with theoretical results. In Section IV, we present experimental results for the manufactured panel and compare with ray tracing simulations. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.\n"

The RIS\ngain values are found for four different modes each for five different sizes of RIS panels. The RIS gain results for the continuous load impedance design are listed in Table I. It is worth noting that each RIS model needs two gain values: Grx is the RIS gain in the direction from RIS to TX, and Gtx is the RIS gain in the direction from RIS to RX. Corresponding to our RIS designed for the normal incidence angle and four reflection angles, Grx is obtained at 0\u00b0, and Gtx is obtained at\n13\u00b0, 27\u00b0, 43\u00b0, and 65\u00b0.\n\nOnce we obtain the RIS gains from CST simulations, the received power at the RX antenna through the RIS can be calculated according to Friis' formula for the links between TX and RIS and then between RIS and RX [15]:\n\n4\u03c0R1 P1 = Gt(\u03b8t, \u03d5t)Grx(\u03b8rx, \u03d5rx) \ufffd \u03bb \ufffd2 , (4) 4\u03c0R2 P2 = Gtx(\u03b8tx, \u03d5tx)Gr(\u03b8r, \u03d5r) \ufffd \u03bb \ufffd2 , (5)\nwhich gives the following path loss estimation [16]:\n\nPr = PtP1P2 = PtGt(\u03b8t, \u03d5t)Grx(\u03b8rx, \u03d5rx)Gtx(\u03b8tx, \u03d5tx)Gr(\u03b8r, \u03d5r)\u03bb4 (4\u03c0)4(R1R2)2 .

The results of the received power from the two methods are shown in Figs. 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), and 1(d) for modes 1 to 4, respectively.\n\nFrom Fig. 1 we can observe that for all four modes, the two methods give very close results. The differences between the two methods are about 0.2 dB to 0.6 dB for mode 1, mode\n2, and mode 3 when the RIS sizes change from 32 \u00d7 32 to\n96 \u00d7 96. For mode 4 the difference is from 0.7 dB to 0.8 dB\nwith the five sizes.\n\nThis agreement is expected because Eq. (1) is valid for theoretically perfect ARs, and from Part I we saw that the RIS design with continuous loads gives a nearly perfect performance. In fact, it can be shown that for ideal ARs with continuous current distribution the considered two path loss models are equivalent. The model of (1) assumes that the RIS captures all the power that is incident on its surface and retransmits it without imperfections. This means that if we consider the same RIS as a conjugate-matched receiving antenna, its effective area Aeff is equal to the geometrical area of the panel cross-section, that is, Aeff = S1| cos \u03b8i|. Likewise, in the transmit regime, we have Aeff = S1| cos \u03b8r|. Using the general relation between the effective area and gain, valid for any linear and reciprocal antenna,\n\n$$G=4\\pi{\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\lambda^{2}}},\\eqno(7)$$\nWe can find the RIS gains for an ideal AR in terms of the panel area and the incidence and reflection angles:\n\n$$G_{\\rm rx}=4\\pi\\frac{S_{1}}{\\lambda^{2}}\\,|\\cos\\theta^{i}|\\tag{8}$$\n\nand\n\n$$G_{\\rm tx}=4\\pi\\frac{S_{1}}{\\lambda^{2}}\\,|\\cos\\theta^{r}|.\\tag{9}$$\nSubstituting Eq. (8) and (9) into Eq. (6) we obtain the same equation as Eq. (1). Therefore, these two methods are equivalent if the RIS operates perfectly. The small differences between the two methods are from the RIS gain differences between CST simulation and the ideal theoretical values given by Eqs. (8) and (9), and they result from the spatial discretization of the reflecting surface.\n\nFrom [11] we conclude that when the RIS size is doubled, the received power should achieve 6 dB gain for a tuned RIS. In these four figures, the received power has about 7 dB, 5 dB,\n4 dB and 3 dB differences for the RIS sizes 32\u00d732 to 48\u00d748, from 48 \u00d7 48 to 64 \u00d7 64 from 64 \u00d7 64 to 80 \u00d7 80, and from\n80 \u00d7 80 to 96 \u00d7 96, respectively. Since the RIS size 64 \u00d7 64\nis four times larger than the size 32 \u00d7 32, the received power with 64 \u00d7 64 size is 12 dB higher than for the 32 \u00d7 32-sized RIS. Similarly, the difference between 48 \u00d7 48 and 96 \u00d7 96-\nsized RIS is also 12 dB, which is consistent with the power scaling law [17].\n"

        "content": "\nThe RIS gain values used in Sec. II-C are from the optimization of continuous reactive loads, corresponding to the assumption that the controllable loads can have arbitrary reactive impedances. In this section, we use the RIS gain results obtained from quantized load impedances, which are summarized in Table I, to investigate the difference between different quantization resolutions. From Part I we explained that the reflection efficiency of the RIS increases when the load quantization resolution changes from 1-bit to 4-bit. This is because the unit cell loads optimization results become more efficient when we have more load impedance values (2 values for 1-bit and 16 values for 4-bit). The reflection wave is more concentrated in the desired directions and the side lobes are better suppressed, which is why the RIS gain values in the desired directions also become higher and gradually get close to the gain when using continuous loads.\n\nIn Fig. 2 we compare the received powers between the designs based on continuous and quantized load values. Figures 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d) show the results for modes 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. The differences between the panels of\n5 different sizes are almost the same for all four modes. As expected, when the resolution increases from 1-bit to 4-bit, the differences between the continuous loads designs and the discrete loads become smaller for all four modes. It can be observed that for 1-bit resolution, the scattering losses are quite high for all four modes, while the 4-bit resolution leads to very similar results as for the continuous loads. The 3-bit resolution gives already relatively good results, i.e., 1.11 dB\nfor mode 4, and less than 0.4 dB loss for modes 3, 2, and 1\nare good enough.\n"

To analyze wave propagation in more realistic environments, ray tracing is a very useful method since it accounts for the effect of the environment. There are several ray tracers already in the academic and industrial use, such as the MATLAB ray tracer, the Wireless InSite from Remcom, the CloudRT from Beijing Jiaotong University, and more. However, there are still no ray tracers that would include an accurately modeled RIS module. To simulate a RIS-assisted scenario, we have to first model a RIS into the ray tracer. In this section, we first incorporate a model of the designed RIS in the Wireless InSite ray tracer and verify the simulated results against the theory. After that, we extend the simulation scenario from a simple single-input single-output (SISO) case to a multipath scenario and analyze the simulation results.\n"

For each RIS size at each propagation mode, we have two RIS patterns, one towards the incidence direction and the other toward the realized anomalous reflection angle. Therefore, in the ray tracer, we first simulate the TX-RIS link where the RIS is used as a receiver. Next, we simulate the RIS-RX link where the RIS is used as a transmitter.\n\nTo verify the RIS modeling in the ray tracer, we set up the same SISO scenario in Wireless InSite as in Sec. II, see Fig. 3. The center frequency is 26 GHz. The TX and RX antennas are initially omnidirectional (0 dB gain). The distance between the TX and RIS is 17 m, and the distance between the RIS and RX is 17.22 m. When the RIS is used as a receiver for the TX-RIS link, the RIS pattern is toward 0\u00b0, facing the TX\nantenna. When the RIS is used as a transmitter for the RIS-RX\nlink, the reflection pattern of the RIS is towards 13\u00b0, 27\u00b0, 43\u00b0, and 65\u00b0 for modes 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. The TX and RX\ndirect link is blocked by a wall, so that there is no LOS path between them. First, the reflection path number is set as 0, so that we only observe the LOS paths TX-RIS and RIS-RX. All walls, ceiling and floor in this scenario are considered as perfect absorbers, to provide a direct point of comparison with the LOS path loss models considered above.\n\nThe comparison results between the ray tracing simulation and method 1 from Sec.

The larger the RIS size, the larger the differences between the two results for all four modes. However, even the largest difference that appears for mode 4 is about 0.6 dB.

The farfield distances of the five RIS sizes are 1.80, 4.04, 7.19, 11.23, and 16.17 m for the sizes of 32 \u00d7 32, 48 \u00d7 48, 64 \u00d7 64, 80\u00d780, and 96\u00d796, respectively, according to the calculation R = 2D2/\u03bb with D the largest dimension of the antenna.\n\nHence, the distance between the TX and the RIS is set to 22 m, and the distance between the RIS and the RX antenna is from 17.4 m to 22.8 m to fulfil the far-field assumption.\n\nThe RX antennas are placed at 10 arcs with the RIS location being the center point of the arcs. The angle range of the RX\nantennas toward the RIS is from 10\u25e6 to 85.4\u25e6 from northwest to southeast in the room. The height of TX, RX, and the RIS is 1.5 m.\n\nTo investigate whether the RX antennas at different locations benefit from the RIS, we simulate the LOS path from the TX to the RIS and from the RIS to each RX antenna for all four modes. Then we take the maximum received power for each RX antenna among all four modes. In this way, the RX antennas located at 13\u00b0, 27\u00b0, 43\u00b0, and 65\u00b0 should all receive strong power due to the RIS assistance. The received power for all the users at different angles and distances from the RIS is plotted in Fig. 6. Figures 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), 6(d), and 6(e)\ndisplay the results for the 32 \u00d7 32, 48 \u00d7 48, 64 \u00d7 64, 80 \u00d7 80, and 96 \u00d7 96 RIS sizes, respectively. The radius of the polar plot is the distance between the RX and the RIS. The RIS is located at point 0 in these figures. The color of these figures' curves represents the received power.\n\nFrom Fig. 6 we can observe that the RXs located at\n13\u00b0, 27\u00b0, 43\u00b0, and 65\u00b0 receive the highest power. The RXs at other angles receive lower power because there is no strong reflection from the RIS in those angle ranges. With an increased distance between the RIS and the RX antenna, the received power is slightly reduced. However, since the distance change is not so much from 17.4 m to 22.8 m, the power reduction is not so significant. The maximum received power at the RXs increases from \u221292.4 dB to \u221274.5 dB with the RIS size increasing from 32 \u00d7 32 to 96 \u00d7 96.\n\nTo have a more detailed look at the received power at different angles, we plot the received power versus the angle results in Fig. 7. At each angle, there are multiple points representing multiple RX antennas at that angle with different distances from the RIS. From Fig. 7(a) to 7(e) are the results for 32 \u00d7 32 to 96 \u00d7 96 RIS sizes, respectively. It is obvious that the received power at the RXs forms four strong beams at the four RIS reflection directions, which is related to the RIS scattering pattern. When the RIS size increases, the scattering pattern of the RIS at each reflection angle also becomes more directive and stronger.\n\nNext, we choose 39 RX antennas that are on the first arc at the 17.4 m distance from the RIS. The received powers at the RX antennas for five RIS sizes are plotted in Fig. 8(a). The calculated differences of received powers at different RIS reflection angles are consistent with the results for the SISO scenario in Sec. III-A. When the angle toward the RX antenna is not at one of the RIS reflection angles, the received power of these RX antennas is much lower. The differences between the five RIS sizes at those angles are also not very significant. The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) results are plotted in Fig. 8(b) to compare the overall received power at all the RX antennas for the five RIS sizes.\n"

        "title": "C. Multi-User Scenario With Multi-Path Propagation",
        "content": "\nIn this section, we consider a multi-path propagation scenario. The setup is the same as in Sec. III-B, except that in this scenario we include reflection paths. It should be noted that since our RIS is designed for illumination at normal incidence and reflections into a set of four angles, it can be effectively used only for these paths and for the reciprocal ones. The RIS scattering patterns for illuminations from other directions need to be calculated separately (for RIS realized as periodical arrays, this issue is considered in [18]). For simplicity, here we consider only one LOS path for the TX-RIS link, but three reflection paths for the RIS-RX link. To investigate the difference of the received power at the RIS between the LOS path and reflection paths, we run simulations with 0, 3, and\n6 reflections, and find that the difference between the LOS and 3 or 6-reflections paths is smaller than 1 dBW, which is very small. Hence, even though it is not so realistic to assume only one LOS path between the TX and the RIS, it is still reasonable to use this assumption for simulations.\n\nThe received power results versus the distances to the RX\nantenna and the angles are shown in Fig. 9. In addition to the results with five RIS sizes that are shown in Figs. 9(b) - 9(f), the results without RIS are plotted in Fig. 9(a). From these figures, we notice that when there is no RIS, only some RX antennas located at the angle of 10\u00b0 and in the range of [26\u00b0 41\u00b0] receive relatively high power, while many RX\nantennas receive only noise. However, when including a RIS in this scenario, almost all RX antennas are covered and receive a significant amount of signal power.\n\nThe received power as a function of the angle is plotted in Fig. 10. Compared to the LOS scenario in Fig. 7, the received powers at the users that are not located along the RIS reflection directions have significant improvement in the multi-path scenario. For example, in the LOS scenario with the RIS size 96 \u00d7 96, the received powers at the RX antennas in the [50\u00b0 57\u00b0] range are in the range of [\u2212109 \u221296] dB.\n\nHowever, in the multi-path scenario, the received powers at those RX antennas are in the [\u2212104 \u221283] dB range and are higher than in the LOS scenario on average. It is obvious that after multiple reflections from the walls, floor, ceiling, and cabinet, the transmitted signals have a good chance of reaching those RX antennas in blind spots.\n\nSimilarly, in Fig. 11(a) we compare the results for RIS of five sizes with 39 RX antennas at the first arc that are 17.4 m away from the RIS. Compared to the case without RIS, the scenarios with RIS lead to significant improvement of received power at these RXs, especially at the RIS reflection directions and with a larger RIS size. The ECDF results of the received power are plotted in Fig. 11(b). The curve for the case of 'No RIS' does not start from zero because many RXs receive just noise, and they are not included in this figure.\n\nIn summary, the strategy of implementing a RIS as an antenna in a ray tracer is proved to be correct, which can be also applied to other ray tracers. The ray tracing simulation results from a SISO and multi-user LOS scenario prove that the maximum received powers at the RX antennas fulfill the power scaling law [17], which is actually from the communication theory where it just considers the RIS element number and phase shifts and does not involve any EM properties of the RIS, but our RIS model is from EM perspective and modeled as a whole antenna. So far we have reached a good agreement when applying the communication theory to a realistic RIS from the EM perspective. In addition to the comparison between the scenario with multiple reflections and without reflections, we can conclude that the contributions of a RIS are highly dependent on its reflection directions, the RIS sizes, and the reflections from the environment. The user located at the RIS reflection angles can receive the maximum power, the bigger RIS size also contributes more power to the user, and reflection paths in the environment can contribute to the user coverage improvement.\n"

        "content": "\nThe measurement scenario is shown in Fig. 12. The dimensions of the auditorium are 14 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 3 (m3). The TX and RX antennas are the same horn antennas with a maximum gain of Gt = Gr = 18 dBi and a beam width of 22\u00b0 at\n26 GHz. The height of the TX, RX, and the AR is 1.5 m, the distance between the TX and AR is R1 = 5.5 m, and the distance between the AR and the RX is R2 = 7 m. The TX horn antenna is connected to a vector signal generator via a cable, the RX horn antenna is connected to a low noise amplifier (LNA), and then connected to a signal & spectrum analyzer via cables. The signal generator is connected to the signal & spectrum analyzer through a reference clock and Ethernet cable for synchronizing the signals. The TX cable loss is Lt = 2.5 dB, the sum of the LNA gain and the RX\ncable loss is Ga = 19.9 dB. We use a 400-MHz channel bandwidth and 16 QAM modulated 5G NR wavemode for transmitted signals, and the transmitted power at the TX side is Pt = 6 dBm.\n\nTo measure the TX-AR-RX link, we use a wave absorber to block the direct link between the TX and the RX antennas. The TX and the AR are fixed and are facing each other. The RX\nantenna is placed at 55\u25e6, 60\u25e6, ..., 85\u25e6 of the AR, respectively, but the distance between each RX location and the AR is always 7 m. We orient the direction of the RX antenna to always face the AR at each location. In the end, we obtain 7\ndifferent received power values at the RX antenna from the 7\ndifferent locations. We denote this power as Pm in dBm.\n\nTo simulate the same measurement scenario in a ray tracer, we first create a 3D model using SketchUp and import it to a ray tracer. The top view of the model is displayed in Fig. 13(a). This 3D model replicates the real dimensions of the whole room and the objects inside it. For practical reasons, the MATLAB ray tracer suits the auditorium scenario better than alternative ray tracers. Therefore, we use the MATLAB ray tracer in this section for simulations.\n\nWe model a horn antenna in MATLAB and use it for TX and RX antennas in ray tracing simulations. The maximum gain of the horn antenna is 18 dBi. Then we use a similar way of implementing RIS as in the Wireless InSite to implement the realistic AR in the MATLAB ray tracer. The locations of the TX, RX antennas, and the AR are the same as in the measurement. Figure 13(b) shows the ray tracing of the TX-AR LOS link and the AR-RXs LOS links. We first set the reflection number as 0 to observe the received power from the AR-assisted LOS links, and compare it with the theoretical results obtained from Sec. II, since the two methods in Sec. II also considers only the LOS paths. Then we set 3\nreflections in ray tracing simulations for the TX-AR and AR- RX links to include the reflection paths from the room objects and compare the results with measurement results, since the reflections cannot be ignored in a realistic environment. We denote the simulated powers at 7 locations as Pr,orig. Then, considering the cable losses and the LNA gain, we obtain PRT,orig = Pr,orig \u2212 Lt + Ga.\n"

        "content": "\nIn this section, we first compare the received power results between the two methods from Sec. II, the measurement result Pm, and the ray tracing simulation result PRT,orig as shown in Fig. 14(a). It is worth noting that method 1 can only give the results at the RIS targeted direction, it cannot be used to calculate received powers at other directions that the RIS is not designed for. In our case, we only consider the received power at 65\u25e6 with method 1 since this AR is designed for 65\u25e6. We denote this result as Pmtd1,orig. With method 2 and ray tracing, we obtain received powers also at other angles by utilizing the respective RIS radiation patterns from CST simulations. The result from method 2 is denoted as Pmtd2,orig. From Fig. 14(a)\nwe observe that the ray tracing results with zero reflection are the same as from method 2, and they are very close to the theoretical result from method 1, which is consistent with our analysis in Sec. II-C and Sec. III-A. However, the ray tracing results with 3 reflections have about 1.4 dB difference compared to measurement results at 60\u25e6 and 65\u25e6.\n\nTo investigate whether this difference is from our ray tracing model or from the measurement system, we perform a reference measurement for the TX-RX link and compare it with theoretical results. In this reference measurement, we do not include the AR and the absorber, but let the TX and RX antennas directly face each other every time when we move the RX antenna to the 7 locations. The results from this measurement is denoted as Pm,LOS in dBm. Because it is very easy to validate this kind of LOS scenario through theory, i.e., we calculate the free space path loss between the two antennas using the equation PFS = PtGtGr\n\ufffd\n\u03bb\n4\u03c0R\n\ufffd2 in W, where R is the distance between the TX and RX antennas. Then adding the cable losses and LNA gain, we obtain a theoretical received power Ptheory = PFS \u2212Lt +Ga in dBW, where the PFS here is in dBW. We find the power differences between the theoretical value and the measurement results are very small: Pdiff =\nPtheory \u2212Pm,LOS = [1.5, 1.6, 1.1, 0.7, 0.3, 1.0, 0.3] dBm for the angles of [55\u25e6, 60\u25e6, 65\u25e6, 70\u25e6, 75\u25e6, 80\u25e6, 85\u25e6], respectively. This difference may be due to the system loss in our measurement setups, including alignment errors of the antennas, and is not included in the theoretical model.\n\nNow if we take into account the Pdiff when comparing the simulations and measurement results, i.e., use this Pdiff to correct the theoretical and simulation results and obtain Pmtd1,correct = Pmtd1,orig \u2212 Pdiff, Pmtd2,correct = Pmtd2,orig \u2212 Pdiff, and PRT,correct = PRT,orig \u2212 Pdiff. The comparison with measurement results Pm is shown in Fig. 14(b). We find the measurement results at 60\u25e6, 65\u25e6, and 70\u25e6 now agree very well with the ray tracing results with 3 reflections. We can thus conclude that our designed RIS works as we expected. It is also proved that our theoretical analysis for a RIS-assisted link is correct, the 3D auditorium model is accurate, the RIS implementation in Wireless InSite and in the MATLAB ray tracer is correct, the theoretical analysis and ray tracing methods work not only for a perfect RIS, but also for a realistic lossy AR.\n"

        "content": "\nIn Part I we studied the scattering synthesis for multimode ARs. Based on that, we designed a periodic AR that supports multiple reflection directions. By optimizing the load impedances of each unit cell, with continuous and 1 to 4-bit resolution quantized reactive loads, the AR can be configured to reflect waves toward one main direction while suppressing reflections in other directions. The designed lossless RIS can achieve almost perfect reflection efficiencies in the desired directions. The experiment with a manufactured finite reflector validated our design and reached a good agreement with CST simulation results. In this Part II, we used the designed perfect RIS and the manufactured reflector prototype to evaluate their EM properties and communication performances. We implemented both the RIS and the AR into two different ray tracers and validated the results with the theory. In addition, we investigated the quantization effect on the RIS implementation and concluded that with a 3-bit quantization resolution, the RIS can already achieve very good results. Furthermore, we analyzed the large-scale fading of RIS-assisted communication links through EM simulation, system-level, and ray tracing simulations, as well as through indoor measurements in a room using a static AR as a test vehicle. The results demonstrated that our RIS design from the EM aspects, RIS implementation in the two ray tracers, and the system-level and ray tracing simulations with the two RISs from the communication aspects, are all correct and consistent with the measurement results.\n\nFrom the EM design perspective, we acknowledge that our designed multi-mode reflector is intended for reflection in discrete anomalous angles. The coverage between these angles is a topic of an extension to this work in the future. The unit cell loads of the multi-mode reflector would be made reconfigurable so that a non-perfect anomalous reflection in the gap angles would be allowed by the design, however improving the coverage between the discrete modal anomalous angles. Another possibility is to construct a multi-mode static anomalous reflector from multiple single-reflection angle subpanels, i.e., not having a RIS as a reconfigurable surface, but multiple static anomalous reflectors side-by-side to implement the same functionality as the multi-mode RIS would do.\n\nFrom the communication perspective, the validated connections between the EM and communication analysis for a RIS can accelerate the RIS technology realization. For example, by passing a limited set of macroscopic RIS parameters from the EM design to the RIS-tailored Vienna system-level simulator, the simulator can deal with realistic RISs in largescale scenarios. In addition, by importing the radiation pattern of a RIS into ray tracers, one can simulate the RISs in different scenarios taking the propagation environment's effects into consideration. By using our approaches with the software, we can obtain a good estimation of the system performance with realistic RISs in realistic scenarios without the need to conduct measurements.\n"
