        "content": "\nWith the emergence of 6G communications, the requirements on spectrum and energy efficiency are becoming more and more stringent [1]. On one hand, 6G communications will facilitate the ubiquitous deployment of wireless devices, massive access to which poses a great challenge to the scarce spectrum resources. On the other hand, the radio-frequency\n(RF) components used in wireless devices are energy-hungry, which is most unlikely to attain satisfactory energy efficiency performance. The two drawbacks may seriously restrict the application of 6G communications in the near future. Thus, how to overcome the drawbacks is worthy of investigations.\n\nRecently, symbiotic radio (SR) communications [2] has been emerged as a promising solution to the above drawbacks. In a typical SR system, wireless devices from the secondary system can reuse the spectrum band allocated to the primary transmission and take a ride over the primary signals for passive information delivery. Thus, these devices do not need an additional spectrum band and are unnecessary to equip with RF components. This setup boosts the system spectrum and energy efficiency and is friendly to 6G communications. Motivated by this advantage, SR has been widely investigated\n[2]\u2013[5]. In [2], the parasitic SR (PSR) paradigm was designed to adapt the diversified communication requirements. In [3], the duration ratio between the primary and secondary signals to attain a mutualistic relationship for SR communications was investigated. In [4], the impact of finite blocklength channel codes on the secondary transmission was studied. In [5], the cell-free paradigm was proposed for SR communications to avoid the interference caused by the cellular network structure and extend network coverage. However, the system performance of [3]\u2013[5], especially the secondary transmission, was not satisfactory. One important reason for this phenomenon is that the antennas at the primary transmitter (PT) in [3]\u2013[5] was located on fixed positions, based on which the degrees of freedom (DoFs) for achieving high spatial diversity cannot be fully leveraged.\n\nTo address the challenge above, an emerging concept, movable antenna (MA), has been proposed as an efficient approach since it can make full use of the spatial DoFs [6]\u2013 [8]. Unlike conventional antennas with fixed positions, the flexible cable is utilized to establish the connection between each MA and its corresponding RF chain, enabling the position of each MA to be dynamically adjusted to construct a favorable wireless environment [6]. Currently, the investigation of MA\nempowered wireless communications is in its quite early stage.\n\nIn [7], the positions of MAs at the transmitter and receiver were jointly optimized to capture the ultimate downlink system capacity. The authors in [8] shifted their attention to MA based uplink communication systems with multiple users. The results in [7] and [8] demonstrated that the application of MAs can achieve amazing system performance improvement.\n\nHowever, how to apply MAs to handle the unsatisfactory communication performance in SR systems has not been solved, especially when both primary and secondary transmissions are taken into account. To fill in this research gap, in this paper, we propose an MA empowered scheme for the SR communication system, which comprises of a PT, a backscatter device (BD) and a primary user (PU). The PT is equipped with MAs to send primary signals to the PU with a fixed antenna (FA). By considering the PSR paradigm, the FA-based BD takes a ride over the primary signals for delivering its own information to establish the secondary transmission. Under this setup, the MAs at the PT are utilized to wholly explore the DoFs for boosting the primary and secondary transmissions. Moreover, we investigate a primary transmission rate maximization problem under the bit error rate (BER) constraint on the secondary transmission. To handle the non-convexity faced by the original problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework to decompose it into two sub-problems. For the sub-problem of designing the transmit beamforming, the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semi-definite processing (SDP) are both leveraged to find a near-optimal solution. While, the simulated annealing\n(SA) modified particle swarm optimization (SA-PSO) method is utilized to solve the sub-problem of optimizing the positions of MAs. Finally, numerical results are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance provided by utilizing the MAs at the PT and the proposed algorithm with the SA-PSO.\n"

This setting ensures that the constraint C4 can be finally met, i.e.,\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdR(p(q)\ns )\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd will trend to be zero with the iterations.\n\n2) Updating of the particles' positions and velocities: The updating of the s-th particle's position is controlled by the locally optimal position of itself, i.e., p(q)\ns,best, and the globally optimal position among all the particles, i.e., p(q)\nbest, which are evaluated by using the fitness function (9). According to [8], the velocity and position of the s-th particle are updated based on (11) and (12), which are given by\n\nv(q+1) s = \u03c9v(q) s + c1r2(p(q) s,best \u2212 p(q) s ) + c2r3(p(q) best \u2212 p(q) s ), s = 1, . . . , S, (11) p(q+1) s = p(q) s + v(q+1) s , s = 1, . . . , S, (12)\nwhere \u03c9 is the inertia weight parameter, c1 and c2 are the step size factors, r2 and r3 are random parameters and uniformly generated from [0, 1]. If the updated positions violate the constraint C3, the following operation will be implemented as [8]\n\n$$z_{s,k}^{(q)}=\\begin{cases}z_{\\min},&\\text{if}\\quad z_{s,k}^{(q)}<z_{\\min},\\\\ z_{\\max},&\\text{if}\\quad z_{s,k}^{(q)}>z_{\\max},\\\\ z_{s,k}^{(q)},&\\text{otherwise},\\end{cases}\\tag{13}$$\n\nwhere $z_{s,k}^{(q)}\\in\\{x_{s,k}^{(q)},y_{s,k}^{(q)}\\}$. The update of the particles' positions and velocities is presented in step 6 of Algorithm 1.\n\n_3) Updating of the globally optimal position_: To avoid the solution space shrinking and the deterioration of solution accuracy suffered by the traditional PSO method, the SA method is adopted here, based on which a worse solution than the current one may be accepted with the probability $\\epsilon$. This operation can prevent the solving process from being limited to the region of locally optimal solutions. It is known that an appropriate setting of $\\epsilon$ is important for convergence performance and solution accuracy. According to [11], $\\epsilon$ can be updated as\n\n$$\\epsilon=\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{w}^{*},\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{best}}^{(q)})-\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{w}^{*},\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{best}}^{(q+1)})}{T^{(q)}}\\right),\\tag{14}$$\nwhere T (q) is the system temperature in the q-th iteration and updated as T (q+1) =\nQ\u2212q Q T (q), where Q is the maximum number of iterations for the SA-PSO method. It is known that the setting of T (0) is empirically. This update of the globally optimal position is shown in steps 13-23 of Algorithm\n1. Specifically, in step 13, we sort p(q+1)\ns for s = 1, . . . , S\nin the decreasing order in terms of its corresponding fitness function F(w\u2217, p(q+1)\ns\n). From steps 16-20, the decision of whether accepting a worse solution than the current one is made. p(q+1)\n\u031f\ndefined in step 17 of Algorithm 1 represents the\n\u031f-th particle in the (q + 1)-th iteration, and \u031f is randomly generated from the region [0, q + 1].\n"

The remaining parameters are set as follows: $P_{\\mathrm{max}}=38$ dBm, $\\alpha=0.8$, $d_{\\mathrm{min}}=0.5\\lambda$, $v=-10$\n2 ]. The remaining parameters are set as follows: Pmax = 38 dBm, \u03b1 = 0.8, dmin = 0.5\u03bb, \u03c5 = \u221210\ndB, \u03bd = 1.8, L = 9, Q = 150, S = 150, c1 = c2 = 1.4,\n\u03c9 = 1.2, r1 = 50, \u03c32 = 10\u22128, and \u02c6\u033a = 10\u22122. For performance comparison, the proposed MA empowered scheme with the PSO, the FA empowered scheme and the random transmit beamforming scheme are exploited.\n\nFig. 2 investigates the variance of the primary rate versus the maximum transmit power. It is obvious that increasing the maximum transmit power results in the improvement of the primary rates for all schemes. As indicated in Fig. 2, the proposed scheme with the SA-PSO can achieve a higher primary rate than the proposed scheme with the PSO, which confirms that the modification on the PSO method by utilizing the SA can guarantee a satisfactory solution space and thus find a solution with better accuracy. Compared to the FA empowered scheme, the utilization of MAs at the PT can ensure better system performance. It is because moving the antenna positions can create favorable channel conditions between the PT and the PU and between the PT and the BD.\n\nFig. 3 shows how the number of transmit/receive paths affects the primary rate. It is seen that the existence of more paths has a positive effect on the improvement of the primary rate. This is due to the fact that more paths can ensure a greater multi-path gain, thereby enhancing the smallscale fading. From Fig. 3, we also find that optimizing the transmit beamforming is a significant factor affecting the primary rate. For example, compared to the FA empowered scheme, the random beamforming scheme even results in a\n21.8% performance loss with L = 3. It is because without the beamforming design, the transmitted signal from the PT will not beam towards the PU and the BD, thereby reducing the received signal power at the PU.\n\nFig. 4 depicts the primary rate versus the number of antennas. By deploying more antennas at the PT, the primary rates of all schemes increase since an improved spatial diversity gain can be achieved. Similar to Figs. 2 and 3, our proposed scheme with the SA-PSO outperforms the benchmarks, which again demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing the MA technology and the SA-PSO method to ensure favorable channel conditions.\n\nFig. 5 presents the position variation of a selected antenna versus the AO iterations. As shown in Fig. 5, the updating paths of the selected antenna for the SA-PSO and PSO are much different. Obviously, the SA-PSO method can provide a larger solution space for updating the antenna position. Moreover, we can find that the AO framework can converge after only five iterations. This observation indicates the superior convergence performance of the proposed algorithm.\n"

To optimize the primary transmission rate under the BER constraint on the secondary transmission, we have proposed an AO framework to iteratively optimize the transmit beamforming by using the SCA and SDP methods and optimize the positions of MAs by using the SA-PSO method. Finally, we have conducted numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MA empowered scheme with the SA-PSO.\n\nFrom numerical results, we have derived the the following observations: 1) the flexible positions of antennas at the PT can provide a higher spatical diversity for both primary and secondary transmissions; 2) creating a multi-path environment has a positive effect on system performance.\n"
