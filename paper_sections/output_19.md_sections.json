In this paper, we present the fundamentals of general DD communications from the viewpoint of the Zak transform. We start our study by constructing DD domain basis functions aligning with the time-frequency\n(TF)- consistency condition, which are globally quasi-periodic and locally twisted-shifted. We unveil that these features are translated to unique signal structures in both time and frequency, which are beneficial for communication purposes. Then, we focus on the practical implementations of DD Nyquist communications, where we show that rectangular windows achieve perfect DD orthogonality, while truncated periodic signals can obtain sufficient DD orthogonality.\n\nParticularly, smoothed rectangular window with excess bandwidth can result in a slightly worse orthogonality but better pulse localization in the DD domain.

        "content": "\nNext generation wireless networks are expected to provide high throughput and ultra-reliable communications services to facilitate the various emerging applications. To meet the stringent requirements imposed by these emerging applications, such as high frequency bands, high mobility, conventional wireless waveforms, e.g., orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), require sophisticated adaptation, which not only complicates the system design but also degrade the system performance potentially. In light of this, new wireless waveforms need to be developed.\n\nOrthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation was recently proposed in [2] as a means for next generation wireless communications. The advantages of OTFS come from the symbol placement in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, which allows the information symbol to have a direct interaction to the DD domain channels. As a result, appealing DD domain channel properties are naturally exploited, including quasi-static, path separability, and compactness [3], [4]. This channel exploitation has translated into various improvements of communication performance, as evidenced by many existing works [5]\u2013[8]. In [9], a DD domain channel estimation scheme based on the embedded pilot was proposed, where one strong pilot symbol is placed in the DD domain with a sufficiently large guard space. Thanks to the DD domain path separability, good channel estimation performance can be achieved by simply comparing the received and the transmitted pilot symbols. The error performance of OTFS was studied in [10], where the authors have shown that OTFS almost surely achieves the full channel diversity over sparse Rayleigh fading channels even with a relatively small frame size. This conclusion is further extended in [11], which reported that coded OTFS systems have an important diversity and coding gain tradeoff depending on the number of resolvable paths in the channel. Consequently, OTFS only requires a relaxed code design comparing to OFDM. Furthermore, the DD domain path separability gives rise to novel MIMO communication designs using OTFS waveforms. Particularly, path-oriented precoding designs have shown good compatibility to both point-to-point (P2P) MIMO and multi-user (MU) MIMO transmissions in terms of both achievable rates and computational complexity [12], [13]. In addition, recent works on integrated communications and sensing (ISAC) have also demonstrated the great potential of OTFS [14], [15].\n\nLet us have a historical recap of the OTFS literature. In the early papers [2], [16], [17], OTFS was implemented based on the overlay of OFDM by using the two-dimensional (2D) inverse symplectic finite Fourier transforms (ISFFT), which is known as the two-stage implementation. Such an implementation demonstrates a strong compatibility with the main stream OFDM standards but did not highlight the unique properties of OTFS promised by the Zak transform, which is the fundamental mathematical tool connecting the DD domain and the time/frequency domain. After several years of prosperity, OTFS has gradually become a popular topic in both academia and industry. However, most of the OTFS studies were still focused on the two-stage implementation of OTFS until now. Noticeably, the two-stage implementation is limited by the OFDM structure, where a time-frequency (TF) domain pulse, commonly a rectangular window with duration of an OFDM symbol, was adopted for carrying the precoded (using ISFFT) information symbols. Note that the ISFFT spreads each DD domain information symbol to all TF domain symbols, which are carried by different TF domain pulses. Consequently, each DD domain information symbol is modulated onto many different pulses, resulting in the so-called \"pulse discontinuity\" [18].\n\nThe pulse discontinuity may introduce abrupt changes of the transmitted signal, which can cause a large out-ofband (OOB) emission and thereby degrading the system performance. However, the impact of pulse discontinuity is almost invisible in numerical simulations if the OOB issue was not considered, which is often the case when the system was evaluated by Monte Carlo methods developed based on the discrete channel model, e.g., [19]. To solve the OOB issue, many OTFS variants have been proposed recently. The orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation was proposed in [18], where a realizable orthogonal basis with respect to DD resolutions was constructed using the staggered multi-tone modulation. In this context, the authors further proposed delay-Doppler multicarrier (DDMC) modulation using delay-Doppler orthogonal pulses (DDOP) and demonstrated that sufficient DD orthogonality can be achieved by using periodically extended root-raised cosine (RRC) pulses or a Nyquist pulse train [20]. Furthermore, a framework of pulse shaping on DD plane was reported in [21], where a low-complexity pulse shaping structure based on fast convolution was proposed. The proposed framework is compatible to various shaping pulses, and an end-to-end discrete system model was also provided.\n\nMore recently, researchers have realized the importance of the Zak transform to OTFS. The Zak transform was originally introduced in the field of solid state physics by J. Zak [22] and was then extended to the field of signal processing [22]. It is a mathematical tool that highlights the physical interpretation between time/frequency and DD. Compared to the OTFS implementation based on OFDM transceivers, implementation using the Zak transform requires less complexity and preserves clear physical insights. A main feature of OTFS transmissions based on the Zak transform is that it generally does not require the overlay with OFDM. Therefore, it is also known as the one-stage implementation. The discrete Zak transform (DZT)-based OTFS realization was proposed in [23], where input-output relation of OTFS was studied and discussed from the DZT viewpoint. However, due to the discrete nature of DZT, the DZT-based OTFS exhibits a degraded performance when the DD resolutions are not sufficient (commonly known as the \"fractional delay and Doppler\"). In [24], a Zak transform based implementation of OTFS was presented. Specifically, the DD domain continuous symbol carrier (known as the basis function) was derived according to the Zak transform, which was shown to be sufficiently localized. Furthermore, bandwidthlimited and time-limited window functions were applied to truncate the basis functions, where the author showed that rectangular windows can achieve the perfect DD orthogonality. This work has been extended to the OTFS\n2.0 modulation recently in [25], [26]. The OTFS 2.0 highlights the DD domain information transmission based on the Zak transform, where the end-to-end input-output relation was characterized by the *twisted-convolution* in the DD domain. In particular, the OTFS 2.0 intentionally precoded information symbols to satisfy the quasi-periodicity property of the Zak transform, and apply DD domain shaping pulses at both the transmitter and receiver to convey information. As a result, OTFS 2.0 exhibits a mathematically simple input-output relation defined purely in the DD\ndomain. However, all real-world signal transmissions are essentially implemented in time, and unfortunately, not all DD domain signals are realizable in time1. Therefore, how to implement OTFS and in general DD communications in practice require further studies.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to fill the gap between the DD communication theory based on the Zak transform and its practical implementation. Specifically, we present the fundamentals of practical DD communications based on the Zak transform without relying on the overlay of the transceivers of TF domain multicarrier waveforms, e.g., OFDM. In contrast of the previous works [25], [26], we highlight the practical implementation of DD Nyquist communications using realizable pulse shaping filters, where an end-to-end input-output relation is also derived from the communication theory viewpoint. Our proposed DD communication framework enjoys sufficient DD orthogonality, which may be the exact motivation of OTFS. More importantly, we highlight the physical interpretation of DD and time/frequency from a signal processing point of view. We show that periodicities in time and frequency will result in localizations in Doppler and delay, according to the theory of Zak transform. However, exact periodicity requires infinite time and frequency resources, which are not realizable in practice. Therefore, truncating periodic time and frequency signals are well motivated, and the DD localizations are degraded to DD orthogonality due to the truncation. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.\n\n- We define a group of equally-spaced basis functions corresponding to information symbols, which are constructed in a special way such that their transformations in both time and frequency are consistent. Such basis functions naturally incorporate the twisted-convolution insight in the DD domain, which exhibit quasiperiodicity globally while are twisted-shifted locally. Particularly, the constructed basis function allows straightforward calculation of its ambiguity function, which is in line with the DD domain pulse shaping and matchedfiltering. Furthermore, we unveil that the DD domain global feature of such functions translates into a train of pulses, while their local feature translates into signal tones in both time and frequency. This unique structure\nis known as the \"pulsone\" in the literature of OTFS.\n- We further present the practical realization of basis function by applying practical filters to the ideal basis\nfunctions for symbol transmissions. We introduce the TF-consistent pulse shaping for deriving the practical basis\nfunctions, where both time domain and frequency domain window functions are applied for obtaining a roughly\ntime-limited and bandwidth-limited basis function. We derive the corresponding DD domain representation and\nambiguity function of such basis functions, and further demonstrate that basis functions enjoying sufficient localization and orthogonality can be achieved by applying truncated periodic signals for windowing. More\nimportantly, we verify that the rectangular windows enjoy perfect DD orthogonality.\n- We present the practical pulse shaping implementation for DD communications in the time domain by introducing reasonable approximations. Based on the proposed implementation, we further derive the input-output relation of general DD communications with various shaping pulses over underspread channels. Particularly, we\ndemonstrate that the above input-output relation are well-characterized by the ambiguity function of the basis\nfunction in the asymptotical regime, which yields essentially the same results as in [25], [26]. Furthermore, we also verify that the above input-output relation using rectangular windows converges to that of OTFS implemented using OFDM transceivers with rectangular TF pulses [19].\n- We provide numerical results of DD communications using various shaping pulses in terms of the bit error\nrate (BER), pragmatic capacity [27], [28], and power spectral density (PSD). The practical advantages of the\nproposed scheme are verified based on these results.\n\nNotations: The blackboard bold letters A, Z, and E denote the energy-normalized constellation set, the integer number field, and the expectation operator, respectively; \"\u2217\" and \"\u2297\" denote the convolution and kronecker product, respectively; \"[\u00b7]M\" denotes the module-M operation. \"(\u00b7)\u2217\" denotes the conjecture operation. sinc (x) is the sinc function2 defined by sinc (x)\n\u2206= sin(\u03c0x)\n\u03c0x\n.\n\nWe will interchangeably use two sets of representations to describe the same signal in different domains.

        "content": "\nIn this section, we will review some fundamental properties of the Zak transform that are available in the literature [22], [29]. We note that the Zak transform plays an important role in the context of the Gabor expansion [29], and its significance has been widely explored in many engineering aspects including image processing [30], texture segmentation [31], and more recently, wireless communications [2]. Note that the Zak transform is a version of the Poisson summation formula [32] and therefore it holds for general Schwartz functions. In fact, it is well-defined almost everywhere in the L2 space, see Lemma 8.2.1 in [32]. Specifically, the Zak transform can be defined equivalently for both time domain signals and frequency domain signals as shown in the following [32], where we assume that the underlying time domain signal and its Fourier transform are well-defined in the Wiener space.\n\nDefinition 1 (*The Zak Transform*): Let x (t) be a complex-valued time-continuous function, whose Fourier transform is given by X (f). Furthermore, let T be a positive constant. Then, the Zak transform can be defined equivalently in both time and frequency by [22], [29]\n\n$$\\mathcal{Z}_{x}\\left(\\tau,\\nu\\right)=\\left(\\mathcal{Z}\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{T}}\\ x\\right)\\left(\\tau,\\nu\\right)\\stackrel{{\\Delta}}{{=}}\\sqrt{T}\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}x\\left(\\tau+kT\\right)e^{-j2\\pi k\\nu T}\\tag{1}$$\nand\n\n$$\\mathcal{Z}_{x}\\left(\\tau,\\nu\\right)=\\left(\\mathcal{Z}T_{\\mathrm{F}}\\ X\\right)\\left(\\tau,\\nu\\right)\\stackrel{{\\Delta}}{{=}}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}e^{j2\\pi\\nu\\tau}\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}X\\left(\\nu+\\frac{k}{T}\\right)e^{j2\\pi k\\frac{\\pi}{T}},\\tag{2}$$\n\nrespectively, for $-\\infty<\\tau<\\infty$ and $-\\infty<\\nu<\\infty$.

In what follows, we restrict ourselves by only considering cases where the above convergence holds without explicitly mentioning.

        "content": "\nIn this section, we focus on the application of Zak transform for communication systems, where the transmitted continuous signal is constructed by modulating a set of discrete information symbols using basis functions. Specifically, we consider a type of DD domain signal transmissions for communication as shown in Fig. 1, where a set of discrete DD domain symbols are linearly modulated onto a family of continuous DD domain waveforms, i.e., DD\ndomain basis functions. Let XDD be the DD domain symbol matrix of size M \u00d7 N, where M and N are numbers of delay and Doppler bins, respectively. Let XDD [l, k] be the (l, k)-th element of XDD, which is modulated onto the corresponding DD domain basis function \u03a6\u03c4l,\u03bdk DD (\u03c4, \u03bd) via DD domain pulse shaping. Therefore, the considered linearly modulated DD communication signal is formulated as\n\n$$s_{\\rm DD}\\left(\\tau,\\nu\\right)=\\sum_{l=0}^{M-1}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X_{\\rm DD}\\left[l,k\\right]\\Phi_{\\rm DD}^{\\tau_{\\rm DD}}\\left(\\tau,\\nu\\right),\\tag{10}$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi_{\\rm DD}^{\\tau_{\\rm DD}}\\left(\\tau,\\nu\\right)$ is the DD domain basis function with offset $\\tau_{l}$ and $\\nu_{k}$ and it will be detailed in the coming \nsubsection.\n\nIn this paper, we consider an arbitrary DD domain channel hDD (\u03c4, \u03bd), which is written as [4]\n\n$$h_{\\rm DD}\\left(\\tau,\\nu\\right)=\\sum_{p=1}^{P}h_{p}\\delta\\left(\\tau-\\tilde{r}_{p}\\right)\\delta\\left(\\nu-\\tilde{r}_{p}\\right).\\tag{11}$$\n\nIn (11), $P$ can be interpreted as the number of resolvable paths, $h_{p}$, $\\tilde{r}_{p}$, and $\\tilde{r}_{p}$ are the channel coefficient, delay,\nand Doppler shift corresponding to the p-th path, respectively, where \u02dc\u03c4p = \u02dc\u03c4p\u2032 and \u02dc\u03bdp = \u02dc\u03bdp\u2032 for p \u0338= p\u2032 do not hold simultaneously. Furthermore, we consider that hDD (\u03c4, \u03bd) satisfy the *crystallization* condition [25], [26], which requires that\n\n$$\\tilde{\\tau}_{\\rm max}-\\tilde{\\tau}_{\\rm min}<T\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\rm max}-\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\rm min}<\\frac{1}{T},\\tag{12}$$\nrespectively. Here, \u02dc\u03c4max and \u02dc\u03c4min are the maximum and minimum values of the delays, while \u02dc\u03bdmax and \u02dc\u03bdmin are the maximum and minimum values of the Doppler shifts.

We observe that the DD\ndomain basis functions exhibit quasi-periodicity globally, and its constructed by locally twisted-shifting the atom pulse \u03d5 (\u03c4, \u03bd). Specifically, the quasi-periodicity aligns with the property of the Zak transform, which characterizes the global structure of the DD domain basis functions across infinite numbers of regions with the size of the fundamental rectangle. On the other hand, the twisted-shift aligns with the TF-consistency condition, characterizing the local structure of the DD domain basis functions across M delay bins and N Doppler bins.\n\nThe significance of the characteristics of the DD domain basis functions have been discussed [25], [26]. But here we propose a different viewpoint from the DD domain pulse structures. We argue that the global and local characteristics allow the DD domain basis functions have direct time domain and frequency domain interpretations via exploiting the properties of the Zak transform, e.g., (3) and (4).

As an example, we demonstrate the basis functions in different domains in Fig. 3, where we assume M = N = 2 and mark the corresponding time and frequency pulses the same colors as those in the DD grids. As shown in the figure, the DD domain basis function becomes 1D pulsone in either time or frequency, while showing a particular response pattern according to the delay and Doppler offsets. Particularly, we have the following observations:\n\n- DD domain global properties characterize the time and frequency periodicity: The DD domain global\ncharacteristics are translated into the summation and integral terms in (29) and (30), which leads to a train of\npulses in the time and frequency domains that are apart in time by T and apart in frequency by 1\nT , respectively.\n- DD domain local properties characterize time and frequency tones: The DD domain local characteristics\nare translated into the phase terms (signal tones) ej2\u03c0\u03bdk(t\u2212\u03c4l) and e\u2212j2\u03c0f\u03c4l in (29) and (30).\n- Time and frequency spreading: The DD domain basis function is spread in both time and frequency\nsimultaneously following a periodic manner with respect to T and\n1\nT , leading to a potential of achieving\nfull channel diversity4. Specifically, the special signal structure of (29) and (30) is known as the *pulsone* [25],\n[26], which is essentially a *pulse train* modulated by a *complex tone*.\n- Time and frequency limiting cases: By letting T \u2192 \u221e, the time domain basis functions are separated only\nby the time offset \u03c4l, yielding a pure time division multiplexing (TDM)-type of signaling; By letting T \u2192 0,\nthe frequency domain basis functions are separated only by the frequency offset \u03bdk, yielding a pure frequency\ndivision multiplexing (FDM)-type of signaling.\n"

In fact, this result is not unexpected.\n\nNote that both \u039eDD consists of a family of pulses with different Doppler/delay offsets.

Considering the practical implementation of DD communications, we restrict ourselves to only consider the case that the DD\ndomain basis function is firstly truncated in frequency and then truncated in time following the TF-consistency condition.

(42)\nIt is not surprising to see from (42) that the truncated DD domain basis function is fully determined by the DD domain representations of the time and frequency windows. More specifically, we notice that the the resultant truncated DD domain basis function coincide with the shape of the time domain window along the Doppler axis, while its response along the delay axis is determined jointly by both the time and frequency domain windows.\n\nTo further discuss the insight based on (42), let us consider time and frequency windows with specific constraints.\n\nWe consider the time domain window has a finite time duration from t \u2208\n                                                                      \ufffd\n                                                                       0, \u02dcNT\n                                                                             \ufffd\n                                                                              , while the frequency domain\n\nwindow has a finite bandwidth f \u2208\n                                  \ufffd\n                                    0,\n                                      \u02dc\n                                      M\n                                      T\n                                        \ufffd\n                                         , respectively, where \u02dcN \u2265 N and\n                                                                           \u02dc\n                                                                          M \u2265 M.

The time and frequency domain basis functions with rectangular windows are shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), where M = 16, N = 8, and T = 1. As shown in the figure, the basis functions in both time and frequency domains remain the pulsone structure, where the \" local pulses\" in time and frequency are sufficiently narrow and are separated by T and 1/T , respectively. In fact, this is not unexpected as the width of these pulses are roughly determined by the inverse of the windows'\nbandwidth and time duration [25], [26]. We shall refer to this property as the *TF separability property* of the basis function, which holds sufficiently in the asymptotical regime, i.e., sufficiently large \u02dc\nM and \u02dcN. Furthermore, we note that the frequency domain signal has slight excessive bandwidth due to the time domain windowing, which is commonly referred to as the OOB emission. Note that the impact of the OOB emission is determined by the underlying time domain window.\n\nWe demonstrate the truncated DD domain basis functions with different windows in Fig. 5(a) to Fig. 5(d), including the rectangular window (termed \"Rect + Rect\"), the root-raised cosine (RRC) window5 with a roll-off factor 0.3 (termed \"RRC + RRC\"), and cosine window (termed \"Cos + Cos\"), which is obtained by truncating the\n\ncontinuous cosine signal cos (t) from t \u2208\n                                         \ufffd\n                                          0, \u02dcNT\n                                                \ufffd\n                                                  in time and f \u2208\n                                                                  \ufffd\n                                                                   0,\n                                                                       \u02dc\n                                                                      M\n                                                                      T\n                                                                        \ufffd\n                                                                          in frequency, respectively. Specifically,\n\nwe consider M = N = 32 and T = 1, and we intentionally consider the DD domain basis function located in\n\nthe middle of the fundamental rectangle for a better illustration. For both \"Rect + Rect\" and \"Cos + Cos\" cases,\n\nwe have \u02dc\n       M = M and \u02dcN = N, while for the \"RRC + RRC\" case, \u02dc\n                                                          M and \u02dcN are slightly larger than M and N\n\nto account for the excessive bandwidth/time duration. From Fig. 5(a), we observe that using rectangular windows for basis function truncation results in a sufficiently localized pulse in the DD domain, while suffering from slight\n\npower leakage in both the delay and Doppler dimensions. Furthermore, for RRC windows with excessive time and frequency resources, we can see that the truncated basis function is still sufficiently localized but enjoys a much less power leakage in both the delay and Doppler dimensions, as shown in Fig. 5(b). This is thanks to the quick decay property of RRC pulses. The delay and Doppler responses of truncated DD domain basis functions with the three windows are presented in Fig. 5(c) and Fig. 5(d). From these two figures, we notice that both \"Rect + Rect\"\nand \"Cos + Cos' cases share roughly the same delay and Doppler responses, except for the fact that the \"Cos\n+ Cos\" case shows slightly less power leakage around \u03c4 = 0.25 and \u03c4 = 0.75. This observation is in line with our derivation in (44), where the actual shape of the time domain window only affect the delay domain response slightly. On the other hand, we notice that the \"RRC + RRC\" case indeed enjoys a quick decay in both delay and Doppler dimensions. However, it may not enjoy the perfect orthogonality as \"Rect + Rect\" and \"Cos + Cos\" cases, as some non-zero values appear at integer times of delay and Doppler resolution.\n"

We have demonstrated some properties of truncated DD domain basis functions using some specific windows. Here, we will continue our discussions by highlighting their connections to the ambiguity function. Notice that after TF-\nconsistent filtering and windowing, the ambiguity function of \u02dc\u03a60,0\nDD (\u03c4, \u03bd) sufficiently characterizes the DD domain matched-filtering output. Therefore, we are motivated to only consider the ambiguity function of \u02dc\u03a60,0\nDD (\u03c4, \u03bd), which is defined as A\u02dc\u03a6 (\u03c4, \u03bd). In particular, the following theorem characterizes the connections between A\u02dc\u03a6 (\u03c4, \u03bd) and the adopted windows.\n\nTheorem 3 (*Ambiguity Function of Truncated Basis Function*): For DD domain basis functions of the form (31)\nthat are frequency and time truncated as (42), its ambiguity function satisfies\n\n$$A_{4}\\left(\\tau,\\nu\\right)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty}A_{\\text{FW}}\\left(\\tau-nT,\\frac{m}{T}\\right)A_{\\text{FW}}\\left(\\tau,\\nu-\\frac{m}{T}\\right).\\tag{47}$$\n\n**Proof:** The proof is given in Appendix B.\n\nTheorem 3 states that the ambiguity function of truncated DD domain basis functions can be represented by infinite summations of the ambiguity function of the adopted windows in both time and frequency. From Theorem 3, various truncated DD domain basis functions with desired ambiguity function can be designed by carefully selecting the windows in time and frequency. For completeness, we shall also highlight the calculation of A\u02dc\u03a6 (\u03c4, \u03bd) from the DD domain by making use of the TF-consistency condition.

        "content": "\nTheorem 4 essentially states that truncating DD domain basis functions with general periodic windows will result in sufficient orthogonality in both delay and Doppler with respect to T\n\u02dc\nM and\n1\n\u02dc\nNT , where the actual shape of the periodic windows do not matter very much as discussed in the previous subsection. Furthermore, using the methodology adopted in Appendix C, we can show that the ambiguity function also enjoys a semi-periodic response, T\n\ufffd\n, for any integer m and n, i.e., the ambiguity function shall have similar responses at (\u03c4, \u03bd) and\n\ufffd\n\u03c4 + nT, \u03bd + m given a sufficient time duration and bandwidth of the truncated DD domain basis function6. This observation is in line with the quasi-periodicity of the Zak transform. In fact, this is commonly referred to as the delay and Doppler ambiguities in radar theory. However, when the underlying channel is underspread, i.e., the channel satisfies the crystallization condition, the delay spread and Doppler spread are no longer than T and\n1\nT as indicated by (12).\n\nSuch ambiguities do not affect the sensing or communication performance, because the orthogonality is roughly preserved. Furthermore, notice that RRC windows are approximately periodic within their supports for small rolloff factors. Therefore, the DD orthogonality can also be approximately achieved by RRC windows with a smaller roll-off factor. In fact, the above discussions align well with the response of the truncated DD domain basis function in the fundamental rectangle discussed in the previous subsection. Particularly, we may use either RRC windows or periodic windows interchangeably for achieving DD Nyquist signaling in practice. As a matter of fact, a DD\ndomain signaling of using both RRC window and rectangular window appears in [18], [20].\n\nRemark 2: In fact, the localization in (34) and the orthogonality suggested by Theorem 4 are well-aligned with the intuitions of delay and Doppler by considering the time and frequency partition under critical sampling.\n\nIntuitively, the delay and Doppler implies how significant the signal changes in frequency and in time. Clearly, for periodic signals in time and frequency, their Doppler and delay responses will be fully localized, as will their ambiguity functions. However, for periodic signals with truncation, their delay and Doppler responses will not be fully localized, because the signal periodicity is broken due to the truncation. Consequently, their Zak transforms will be sufficiently concentrated depending on the duration of the truncation window in time and frequency, following a \"sinc-like\" pattern. This is because the truncation in time and frequency can be viewed as the multiplication of time and frequency rectangular windows, and the \"sinc-like\" pattern appears naturally as the result of the Zak transform to a rectangular window.\n\nWe demonstrate the DD orthogonality using various time and frequency windows in Fig. 6(a) to Fig. 6(c), where we consider M = N = 32, and three different windows, namely the rectangular window (termed \"Rect + Rect\"), RRC windows with roll-off factor \u03b2 = 0.3 (termed \"RRC + RRC\"), and Cosine window in time and RRC window in frequency (termed as \"Cos + RRC\"). We show the zero-Doppler cuts (ambiguity function with zero Doppler) and the zero-delay cuts (ambiguity function with zero delay) of the three cases in Fig. 6(a), and Fig. 6(b), where it is observed that all the three cases can achieve the sufficient delay orthogonality. Furthermore, we observe that both (\"RRC + RRC\") and (\"Cos + RRC\") cases have an almost zero response for normalized delay around \u2212 T\n2\nand T\n2 . This is due to the quick decay of RRC pulses at the cost of the excess bandwidth. As a result, we can observe a \"spike-like\" ambiguity function, which may also be of interest for radar sensing. We also present the plot of ambiguity function for the (\"RRC + RRC\") case in Fig. 6(c), where we observe that the ambiguity function does have a response that is quasi-periodic along both delay and Doppler, while sufficiently localized within the fundamental rectangle.\n"

According to (52), it is possible to design the DD pulse shaping using a filter bank structure, which includes MN filters that are shifted in time and frequency with respect to the delay and Doppler offsets associated to xDD [l, k]. Such an implementation is straightforward but may not be practical due to the high hardware complexity required for realizing the filter bank. Therefore, we are motivated to consider a simplified and more practical implementation by applying a *sufficiently narrow* time domain pulse FWT (t).

Notice that (54) involves an infinite summation of with respect to n. Let us define xT\n\u2206= [\u02dcxT [0] , \u02dcxT [1] , ..., \u02dcxT [MN \u2212 1]]T as a length-MN\nvector, and we shall highlight that \u02dcxT is a periodically extended version of xT. Furthermore, notice that TWT (t)\nhas a time duration roughly NT . Therefore, it is natural to approximate \u02dcxT by xT in practice. In fact, such an approximation is commonly adopted in the OTFS literature, where xT is often time domain symbol vector for OTFS\ntransmission. As suggested by (54), we can achieve DD pulse shaping by filtering xT in a way similar to that of the single-carrier transmission. However, this must be done with care because the underlying wireless channel may introduce additional delay and Doppler shifts. Therefore, as a common method, we propose to append a sufficiently long cyclic prefix (CP) at the beginning of the frame. Note that the insertion of CP effectively transforms the linear convolution of the time domain channel to the circular convolution. As a result, the received signal can be viewed as a periodized version of the xT shifted by channel delay and Doppler, whose DZT aligns with XDD [29]. In fact, this CP structure is commonly referred to as the \"reduced-CP\" structure in the OTFS literature [19].\n\nGiven the discussions above, we shall consider the DD Nyquist pulse shaping structure as shown in Fig. 7.\n\nIn Fig. 7, the DD domain symbol matrix XDD is first passed to the IDZT module, yielding xT of length-MN.\n\nAfter appending a CP with duration longer than the maximum path delay, the resultant vector is then convoluted with FWT (t) and followed by windowing based on TWT (t), obtaining the time domain transmitted signal sT (t).\n\nParticularly, we require the adopted time domain window is long enough to cover the CP part as well, as shown in Fig. 87. In the figure, we adopt a time domain window with excessive duration for transmission, where we demonstrate the interaction between time and frequency domain windows. We use dashed and solid curves to mark the CP part and the information part of the signal and LCP here denotes the CP length.\n\nAt the receiver side, the time domain received signal rT (t) is first windowed by TW\u2217\nT (t) and then filtered by FW\u2217\nT (t), where the connection between sT (t) and rT (t) is given by (14). After removing the CP, the resultant where (\u03c4, \u03bd) is a pair of arbitrary delay and Doppler shifts that satisfies the *underspread* channel condition, i.e.,\n\u03c4 \u2208 [0, T), and \u03bd \u2208\n\ufffd\n0, 1\nT\n\ufffd\n. Furthermore, let L be the maximum length of intersymbol interference (ISI), i.e.,\n\n$\\frac{1}{T}$) and $|k^{\\prime}-k|>L$.

In fact, the above input-output relation aligns with \nthe matrix form provided in [19], [37] using rectangular pulses in the TF domain.\n\nRemark 3: We have shown above the input-output relation using rectangular windows, where we observe a consistent input-output relation with the two-stage OTFS implementation under integer delay and Doppler when M\nand N are sufficiently large. This is not unexpected, because OFDM signaling with rectangular windows can be implemented in the time domain via *sinc interpolation*. This scheme is commonly known as the discrete multi-tone\n(DMT) transmission [38].\n"

        "content": "\nIn this section, we present the numerical results on the proposed DD communications in terms of BER and pragmatic capacity. Without loss of generality, we consider M = 16 and N = 16, unless specified otherwise and the transmitted symbols are obtained from an energy-normalized QPSK constellation. Furthermore, we assume that the underspread wireless channel has P = 4 independent resolvable paths, where the delay indices and Doppler indices can have fractional values and are uniformly taking values from [0, lmax] and [\u2212kmax/2, kmax/2], respectively, with lmax = 5 and kmax = 3. We will compare the pulse shaping using rectangular windows and RRC windows with roll-off factors \u03b2 = 0.3 in the frequency domain and \u03b2 = 0.1 in the time domain.\n\nWe present the BER performance of the proposed transmission in comparison with OFDM under the same channel condition in Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 9(b), where the OFDM is implemented using the DMT structure with sinc pulses (rectangular windows). To attain a good error performance, we adopt the cross domain iterative detection proposed in [36] for both DD communications and OFDM, which is shown to provide a near-optimal performance for OTFS.\n\nWe notice from Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 9(b) that the DD communications with both rectangular and RRC windows can obtain roughly the same error performance under both fractional and integer delay and Doppler case, especially in the high SNR regime. This is because the cross domain iterative detection can achieve the near-optimal performance that is dominated by the channel fading rather than the exact delay and Doppler response. Furthermore, we highlight that the application of time domain RRC windows may result in slight reduction in the effective symbol energy of few transmitted symbols due to the roll-off part as indicated by Fig. 8. However, this power loss is almost has no influence on the error performance when we choose a relatively small roll-off factor for the time domain RRC\nwindow, e.g., \u03b2 = 0.1. On the other hand, OFDM in both two cases fails to provide good BER results. Particularly, we notice that the BER curves of OFDM have a less steep slope compared to those of DD communications, which indicates that it cannot fully exploit the full channel diversity. However, we highlight that the above results are obtained from uncoded systems. A more detailed analysis between coded OTFS and OFDM appears in [11].\n\nThe pragmatic capacity performance of the considered schemes under the fractional DD case are presented in Fig. 9(c). The pragmatic capacity is characterized by the \"single-letter\" mutual information incorporating the effects of modulation, channel, demodulation, and equalization, which can be computed numerically by using Monte Carlo simulations. More details of pragmatic capacity can be found in [27], [28]. From the figure, we observe that the pragmatic capacities of DD communications using both rectangular and RRC windows achieve roughly the same performance, despite the fact that using rectangular window can achieve a slight rate improvement in the low-to-mid SNR regime. This observation align well with our BER curves in Fig. 9(a).\n\nWe finally examine the PSDs of the transmitted signals in Fig. 9(d), which are obtained by taking the squared values of the Fourier transform of (54). Specifically, we present the PSD corresponding to the rectangular window, and RRC windows with roll-off factors with \u03b2 = 0.1 and \u03b2 = 0.3, and we consider M = 16 and N = 8\nhere. It is not surprising to see that the PSD of transmitted signals using RRC window will exhibit a much lower OOB emission compared to the case of using rectangular windows. Particularly, we observe that the lower OOB emission comes at a price of the excess bandwidth determined by the roll-off factor, and a larger roll-off factor is beneficial for obtaining a lower OOB emission. This observation verifies the practical advantage of the proposed DD communications.\n"
