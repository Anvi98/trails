INTRODUCTION\nXTREMELY\nlarge-scale multiple-input-multiple-output\n(XL-MIMO)\nis expected to fulfill the demands for ubiquitous connecting of the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks [1]. Due to the large spatial multiplexing gain offered by the exploitation of large number of antennas, which is much more than that of massive MIMO in the current fifth-generation (5G)\ncommunications, XL-MIMO\ncan provide a\n10-fold increase in spectral efficiency [2]. Additionally, wideband communications are prospective for more available bandwidth owing to rich spectrum resources at high-frequency bands, e.g., This work is supported in part by National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1801501.

Wu and L. Lu contributed equally to the project and should be considered co-first authors.\n\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) bands [3]. In conjunction with the flexible deployment of high-frequency antennas, wideband XL-MIMO is capable of providing the aforementioned benefits, which is regarded as an essential component in future 6G mobile networks [4].\n\nDue to the extremely large number of antennas and highfrequency bands, the electromagnetic (EM) characteristics of wideband XL-MIMO undergo a fundamental change [5], where the EM radiation field can be partitioned into the far-field and near-field regions. The boundary between these two regions is approximately determined by the Rayleigh distance which is proportional to the product of the square of array aperture and carrier frequency [4], [5]. Outside the Rayleigh distance is the farfield region, where the EM waves can be modeled by the planar waves, e.g., the wave model used in massive MIMO systems [6]. Within the Rayleigh distance, near-field propagation becomes dominant, hence the EM waves need to be accurately modeled by spherical waves [4].\n\nHowever, huge numbers of antennas cause substantial pilot overhead in channel estimation. To address this issue, the compressed sensing (CS) technique is capable of providing accurate channel estimation while maintaining low pilot overhead by fully exploiting the sparsity of the channel. In the conventional massive MIMO systems considering planar wave model, the number of significant paths is much smaller than the number of antennas, hence the channel exhibits sparsity in the angular domain [7]. Nevertheless, for the near-field region, spherical waves introduce a distance ingredient, causing severe sparsity ambiguity in angular-domain representation, which indicates that one single near-field path component spreads towards multiple angles [2]. Then, the near-field channel in the angular domain exhibits weak sparsity, i.e., the number of nonzero channel-taps becomes relatively large. It precludes accurate channel estimation in the angular domain through the conventional CS, since the ratio of the nonzero channel-taps in the channel vector is greater than the upper bound of sparsity required for accurate estimation [8].\n\nMany research efforts have been devoted to mitigating the aforementioned weak sparsity of the near-field channel [2], [9]\u2013\n[11]. For instance, a polar-domain transformation is proposed in\n[2] by sampling the angle uniformly and sampling the distance non-uniformly. The near-field channel is then mapped into the polar domain, involving both angular and distance ingredients, which is sparse enough for accurate estimation by the conventional CS. In [9], the authors propose to decompose the nearfield channel into triple parametric variants firstly, and then use the CS algorithm to estimate the triple parameters of the channel. The works [10] and [11] continue to exploit the polardomain transformation [2] for efficient channel estimation in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) and the mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS environments, respectively. Despite of these achievements providing sufficiently sparse signals that can be recovered by CS\nalgorithms, the bottleneck is that the dimensions of the intrinsic signal processing problems are significantly increased. Quantitatively, when the number of antennas at the base station (BS) is\n256, the number of the polar-domain channel-taps is about 2200, which is 4 times more than the number of conventional angulardomain channel-taps based on Discrete Fourier Transformation\n(DFT) [2]. The excessively high dimensions of signal processing problems cause unacceptable complexity, which precludes these approaches from alleviating weak sparsity in practice.\n\nActually, useful information stemming from the signal itself or communication environments, called side information [12], can help mitigate the weak sparsity of angular-domain near-field channels without increasing dimensions in the signal processing problems. The side information can provide the emphatic correlation between the nonzero channel-taps and the pilot training matrix, and also the confirmed potential to filter out noise interference, which significantly improves the sparsity bound required for accurate estimation, leading to more desirable performance compared with the traditional methods without side information.\n\nThere are two types of key side information for near-field channel estimation in terms of the channel-tap characteristics and the communication system architecture. On one hand, angulardomain sparsity ambiguity offers continuous nonzero channeltaps, which is considered as the structural characteristic information, i.e., block structure [8]. Meanwhile, for multi-carrier communication systems, the positions of nonzero channel-taps are usually the same [2], which indicates that the near-field channel matrix exhibits block sparsity with same sparse patterns among different subcarriers. Current researches have proved that the exploitation of block structure provides more reliable recovery performance than the conventional non-block approaches, since it improves the upper bound of the sparsity level required for reliable recovery [13]. On the other hand, high-frequency systems are likely to be deployed at the same location as lower-frequency systems, giving rise to out-of-band spatial information [14], [15].\n\nA representative example is that millimeter wave (mmWave) systems are typically deployed together with Sub-6GHz systems for providing wide area control signals and multi-band communications [15]. Then, the out-of-band spatial information in lower-frequency Sub-6GHz systems is useful because the spatial characteristics of Sub-6GHz and mmWave channels are similar\n[16]. Specifically, this out-of-band spatial information can be formulated as the weights for index selection of nonzero channeltaps in weighted channel estimation [17].\n\nNevertheless, the investigation of low-complexity near-field channel estimation assisted by side information is still in its infancy. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, there is no system modeling of near-field communications adopting out-of-band spatial information. As the near-field region of lower-frequency communication systems is smaller than that of high-frequency systems, the user may stay in either the near-field or far-field region of the lower-frequency system, and always in the near-field region of the high-frequency system. In this dual-band communication system, the out-of-band spatial information may come from either\n\nnear-field or far-field channels of the lower-frequency system.\nThe formulation of this hybrid communication model, and the extraction and exploitation of the out-of-band spatial information\nremain to be solved. Secondly, the methodology, which employs both out-of-band spatial and structural characteristic information,\nneeds to be carefully designed. Current works using the side information for weighted sparse recovery, e.g., [15], [17]\u2013[19], do not consider the complex signals in practical communication\nscenarios, wherein [15], [17] do not even take block structure into account. It is evident that these existing studies may not be suitable for the out-of-band spatial information- and block structure-assisted near-field channel estimation.\nAgainst the above backgrounds, this paper proposes the scheme\nof side information-assisted dual-band near-field channel estimation in the angular domain. The main contributions are summarized as follows.\n1) The model of dual-band near-field communication systems is formulated. Specifically, the scenario where lowerfrequency and high-frequency systems are deployed simultaneously at the same location is highlighted, where the various frequencies result in different near-field regions. Hence, two communication scenarios, i.e., near-field\nchannel estimation aided by far-field and near-field out-ofband spatial information respectively, are further discussed.\nThe elaborating dual-band model paves the way for the subsequent analysis and estimation procedures.\n2) Theoretical analysis of reliable estimation assisted by side\ninformation is developed. We begin with embedding the dedicated side information and the practical complex channel consideration into the iterative mechanism of the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, leading to a prior factor for correct index selection of nonzero channeltaps. The analysis of minimizing the estimation error corresponding to the prior factor is derived, which involves\njudiciously high-dimensional \u03c72 approximation for tighter\ntheoretical guarantees.\n3) A brand-new near-field channel estimation scheme is proposed, wherein a series of algorithms derived from the OMP leveraging the naturally occurring side information, are developed. Owing to the exploitation of the prior factor derived, the index selections of nonzero channeltaps of the designed algorithms are more accurate, leading to a higher upper bound of the sparsity level required for reliable recovery. This results in more desirable estimation\nperformance than the approaches without the assistance of side information in both on- and off-grid scenarios, where the angles of arrivals/departures are discretely or continuously distributed correspondingly.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II\nintroduces the system model and problem formulation, followed\nby some useful definitions. In Section III, we start with the complex logit-weighted OMP (CLW-OMP) and propose our complex simultaneous logit-weighted block OMP (CSLW-BOMP) algorithm. Moreover, the performance guarantees for these algorithms\nare derived. In Section IV, the simulation results are presented\nand analyzed, and the conclusions are drawn in Section V.\nNotation: We briefly summarize the notations used in this\npaper.

        "content": "\nAs depicted in Fig. 1, we formulate the system model of dual-band XL-MIMO, where Sub-6GHz and mmWave bands are exemplified as the different frequency band solutions. The antennas on the Sub-6GHz and mmWave bands are co-located, aligned and have similar apertures [15]. Specifically, the BS\nand user equippment (UE) are deployed both on Sub-6GHz and mmWave bands with K subcarriers, whose wavelengths are denoted as \u03bb and \u03bb, respectively. On both bands, the BS is composed of N antennas, while each UE has only one antenna.\n\nThe antenna spacing of BS is \u03bb/2 on the Sub-6GHz band and\n\u03bb/2 on the mmWave band. As the boundary of the far-field and the near-field regions, i.e., the Rayleigh distance Z =\n2D2\n\u03bb , is proportional to the carrier frequency and array aperture D [5], the Rayleigh distances of both Sub-6GHz and mmWave systems are\n\n(a) Block sparse near-field channels on\n both Sub-6GHz and mmWave bands\n                                           (b) Sparse far-field channel on Sub-6GHz band and\n                                           block sparse near-field channel on mmWave band\n\nconsiderably large, leading to different channel models presented as follows.\n\nIn conventional far-field scenarios, the electromagnetic radiaition field is modeled by the planar waves. Assume that there exist L significant paths, the far-field channel hfar \u2208 CN\u00d71 can be given by [20], [21]\n\nhfar = N L \ufffd l=1 gle\u2212jkmrla(\u03b8l). (1) L \ufffd\nSince the number of antennas is much larger than that of the significant paths, the far-field channel exhibits sparsity in the angular domain, i.e., the number of nonzero channel-taps is much smaller than that of the total channel-taps [22]. Nevertheless, due to the large antenna aperture D and the high-frequency carrier in XL-\nMIMO systems, the Rayleigh distance is significantly increased [2]. For example, when the carrier frequency is 100GHz and the antenna aperture is 0.5m, the Rayleigh is about 167m, which can cover a whole cell. Consequently, the UE is more likely to fall within the near-field regions where the spherical wave model should be adopted to accurately represent the electromagnetic propagation characteristics. Hence the near-field channel vector hk \u2208 CN\u00d71 can be written as [23]\n\nhk = N L \ufffd l=1 gle\u2212jkmrlb(\u03b8l, rl). (2) L \ufffd\nDifferent from the model in (1), the near-field steering vector b(\u03b8l, rl) depends not only on the angle \u03b8l but also on the radial distance rl. Under such circumstance, b(\u03b8l, rl) exhibits nonlinearity with respect to the antenna index l, and hence should be represented by multiple far-field Fourier vectors instead of a single one. Consequently, the nonzero channel-taps will spread towards multiple angles and exhibits weak sparsity, where the ratio of nonzero channel-taps is relatively large and exceeds the upper bound of the reconstructible sparsity required for reliable recovery of the conventional CS algorithms [2]. Fortunately, this weak sparsity in angular-domain near-field channels can be regarded as the block-sparse structure, which can be leveraged to provide more reliable estimation performance. As illustrated in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), the nonzero channel-taps of near-field channels naturally occur in blocks, which is formulated as xk in the left-hand side of Fig. 2 [24], [25].\n\nTherefore, the different positions of the UE to the BS induce two distinct cases of the dual-band XL-MIMO system, which are presented as follows.\n\nCase I: The UE is located between the Rayleigh distance of the lower sub-6GHz band and the higher mmWave band. Therefore, we should consider the cooperative channel estimation of a sparse far-field Sub-6GHz channel and a block-sparse nearfield mmWave channel.\n\nCase II: The UE is situated within the Rayleigh distance of both the Sub-6GHz and mmWave bands. Hence, the double nearfield cooperative channel estimation should be considered.\n"

The CSLW-BOMP algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1.\n\nFurthermore, in (15), the coefficient D is inversely proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The far-field channel, i.e., the Sub-6GHz system in Case I, is regarded as a special case by setting the block length as 1 or a smaller value compared with the near-field scenario. According to (19), pi of the row-block submatrix with the maximum Frobienus norm in X is normalized to 1 in p, and therefore has the value of infinity under the influence of the prior factor v(pi) = D log(\npi\n1\u2212pi ). As a result, the CSLW-BOMP algorithm always chooses the row-block submatrix in X of the mmWave band which corresponds to the strongest row-block submatrix in the support channel X of the Sub-6GHz system, as the starting support information in the first iteration for recovering X, leading to potential performance enhancement of the algorithm. Similarly, the row-block submatrix with the minimum Frobienus norm in X becomes negative infinity due to the existence of v(pi), which improves the overall performance of our proposed algorithm by consistently ignoring this worst-performing submatrix. The detailed simulation parameters are listed in Table I, and the conventional OMP and BOMP algorithms [24] are adopted for comparison.\n\nIn Fig. 3, the channel estimation performance in on-grid scenarios is compared, with the number of row-block matrices S\nd , number of pilot transmission M fixed to 10 and 50 respectively.\n\nThe normalized mean-square error (NMSE) is leveraged as the criterion, which can be expressed as\n\n$$\\text{NMSE}=\\frac{\\|\\hat{\\mathbf{X}}-\\mathbf{X}\\|_{F}^{2}}{NK},\\tag{20}$$\nwhere X and \u02c6X represent the angular-domain channel matrix and the estimated angular channel, respectively. Moreover, the optimal bound where the channel-tap selections are set to be correct in each iteration is adopted as the upper bound in on-grid scenarios.\n\nIt can be observed that our proposed CSLW-OMP and CSLW-\nBOMP algorithms outperform the traditional OMP and BOMP algorithms, while the performance of CSLW-BOMP algorithm is close to that of the optimal bound benchmark, indicating the effectiveness of the application of out-of-band spatial information.\n\nMoreover, the NMSE performance of BOMP and CSLW-BOMP is also superior to that of the OMP and CSLW-OMP algorithms, since the BOMP and the CSLW-BOMP algorithms take the structural characteristic information into consideration and fully utilizes the block structure, which efficiently enhances the robustness of the algorithm, preventing severe nonzero channel-tap selection errors for assured estimation performance. In addition, the exploitation of side information leads to the continuous decrease of the NMSE of the CSLW-BOMP algorithm as the SNR increases, while other algorithms compared tend to reach a plateau at high SNR scenarios.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4, when the channel matrix H changes from on-grid to off-grid, the NMSE performance varies drastically. Although the channel grid cannot align with the block structure in off-grid scenarios, leading to inherent defect in handling off-grid block structure, the CSLW-BOMP still performs the best between the two block structure-based algorithms due to the assistance of out-of-band spatial information. Meanwhile, the CSLW-OMP algorithm enjoys more desirable performance than other algorithms, since the OMP algorithms can effectively adapt to the off-grid channel features by taking the off-grid structure where d > 1 as on-grid features where d = 1, and the CSLW-\nOMP algorithm can exploit the sophisticated out-of-band spatial information from the Sub-6GHz band to support the mmWave channel estimation.\n\nIn Fig. 5, the on-grid recovery performance of all the algorithms is presented as the number of nonzero blocks S\nd increases, which is in proportion to the sparsity S\nN . We set M = 50 and SNR = 10dB. The probability of accurate estimation, which is defined as the frequencies of the NMSE to be less than a threshold\n\u03b8, is utilized to provide their performance, and \u03b8 = 10\u22122.\n\nIt can be concluded that all the algorithms achieve accurate channel estimation with probability of accurate estimation as\n100% when the sparsity is low. When the sparsity approaches\n0.13, the probability of accurate estimation decreases, but the CSLW-BOMP and CSLW-OMP algorithms still outperform other algorithms without out-of-band spatial information. Furthermore, as the sparsity gradually increases, CSLW-BOMP leveraging both types of side information, i.e., structural characteristic information and out-of-band spatial information, enjoys the best recovery performance, being able to accurately recover the channel matrix even if the sparsity is larger than 0.1. Hence, our proposed CSLW-BOMP algorithm can effectively improve the upper bound of the reconstructible sparsity, and therefore acts as a stunning solution to the weak sparsity problem in near-field XL-MIMO systems. Moreover, the proposed CSLW-OMP provides more assured results than those of the OMP algorithm, which even approaches or exceeds the estimation performance of the BOMP assisted by the block structure, and the OMP has the worst estimation performance because of the most restricted upper bound of reconstructible sparsity.\n\nIn Fig. 6, the probability of accurate estimation is simulated as a function of the compression rate M\nN , which is proportional to the number of required pilot transmissions M. It unveils that the probability of accurate estimation increases with the increase of compression rate, and the CSLW-BOMP still enjoys the highest probability of accurate estimation under the same compression rate among all compared algorithms, which is similar to the conclusions in Fig. 5. Meanwhile, when the probability of accurate estimation is fixed, CSLW-BOMP requires the least pilot transmissions, followed by BOMP, CSLW-OMP and OMP.\n\nFor 100% probability of accurate estimation, CSLW-BOMP can reduce the pilot overhead by 25% when compared to the BOMP algorithm, and 30.1% when compared to the OMP algorithm, substantiating the feasibility of the proposed CSLW-BOMP in low-overhead XL-MIMO communications.\n"

        "content": "\nIn this paper, we concentrate on addressing the weak sparsity challenge of near-field channel estimation resorting to the side information extracted from the spherical wave model and the dualband communication architecture. Specifically, the dual-band near-field communication model is elaborated, where mmWave and Sub-6GHz systems act as co-deployed communication solutions. The structural characteristic information, in conjunction with the out-of-band spatial information stemming from the Sub- 6GHz band, is harnessed for enhancing the channel estimation accuracy, as well as the upper bound of reconstructible sparsity.\n\nA series of variants of the OMP employing side information are proposed, supported by profound analysis revealing the minimum estimation error. Numerical simulations are conducted to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed approaches, indicating fertile advantages in terms of both on- and off-grid estimation accuracy.\n\nProof: First, we focus on deriving the probability distribution of |aH\ni y|2.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume that the first S channel-taps of x are nonzero, i.e., the support set S = {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , S}. As a result, y can be expressed as\n\n$\\mathbf{y}=\\sum_{j=1}^{S}\\mathbf{a}_{j}x_{j}+\\mathbf{n}$, (21)\nwhere ai is the i-th column of A. The correlation term aH\ni y can thus be\n\n$$\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\rm H}\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\rm H}\\Big{(}\\sum_{j=1}^{S}\\mathbf{a}_{j}x_{j}+\\mathbf{n}\\Big{)}=\\sum_{i=1}^{S}(\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\rm H}\\mathbf{a}_{j})x_{j}+\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\rm H}\\mathbf{n}.\\tag{22}$$\nSuppose that M is sufficiently large, aH\ni aj can be approximated to M when i = j according to the law of large numbers, while aH\ni aj\n\u223c CN(0, M) holds for i \u0338= j by the central limit theorem. Similarly, we have aH\ni n \u223c CN(0, M\u03c32) [17].\n\nConsequently, the probability distribution aH\ni y can be calculated separately for i \u2264 S and i > S.\n\nFor i \u2264 S, there exists j \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , S} such that j = i, and aH\ni y can be simplified into\n\n$$\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\rm H}\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\rm H}\\mathbf{a}_{i}x_{i}+\\sum_{j=1,j\\neq i}^{S}(\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\rm H}\\mathbf{a}_{j})x_{j}+\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\rm H}\\mathbf{n}\\tag{23}$$ $$\\approx Mx_{i}+\\sum_{j=1,j\\neq i}^{S}\\mathcal{CN}(0,M)x_{j}+\\mathcal{CN}(0,M\\sigma^{2}).$$\nAssume that all nonzero channel-taps xi have the same modulus g [17], the probability distribution of aH\ni y satisfies that\n\n$$\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\mathrm{H}}\\mathbf{y}\\sim\\mathcal{CN}(Mx_{i},M\\big{(}(S-1)g^{2}+\\sigma^{2}\\big{)}),\\tag{24}$$\n\ndates that the correlation term $\\mathbf{a}_{i}^{\\mathrm{H}}\\mathbf{y}$ follows complex \ncan be expressed as\n\nwhich indicates that the correlation term aH\n                                           i y follows complex\nGaussian distribution with mean Mxi and variance M\n                                                         \ufffd\n                                                          (S \u2212\n1)g2 + \u03c32\ufffd\n           .

Then the incorrect index i2 is wrongly chosen instead of correct i1 if and only if T1+v1 <\nT2 +v2, which is equivalent to T1 \u2212T2 < v2 \u2212v1. We denote the probability of this event as pe(i1, i2), and denote \u2206v = v2 \u2212 v1\nand T = T1 \u2212 T2. In order to obtain the analytical expression of v(pi), the following develops the probability distribution function\n(PDF) of T as a theoretical foundation.\n\nAccording to (27), T is the difference between a non-central\n\u03c72 distribution and a central \u03c72 distribution, and the characteristic function method can be applied to derive the PDF of T .

Since AH\ni N = CN(0, M\u03c32)d\u00d7K, AH\ni Y can be calculated for the cases where Xi \u0338= 0 and Xi = 0 seperately.\n\nFor Xi \u0338= 0, there are S nonzero terms in the correlation term in (47), and only one of them satisfies that i = t. With the assumption that all entries in Xi have the same modulus g, AH\ni Y\ncan be calculated as\n\nAH i Y =M(M, CN(0, M))d\u00d7dXi + (50) t=1,t\u0338=i CN(0, M)d\u00d7dXt + CN(0, M\u03c32)d\u00d7K n \ufffd =M(M, CN(0, M))d\u00d7dXi + CN(0, M(S \u2212 1)dg2 + \u03c32)d\u00d7K.\n\n  Since M(M, CN(0, M))d\u00d7dXi\n                                  =\n                                      MXi + CN(0, (d \u2212\n1)Mg2)d\u00d7K, the expression of AH\n                               i Y can be simplified into\n\nAH\ni Y = MXi + CN(0, M\n            \ufffd\n             (Sd \u2212 1)g2 + \u03c32\ufffd\n                     )d\u00d7K.\n                          (51)\n\nDenoting M\n           \ufffd\n            (Sd \u2212 1)g2 + \u03c32\ufffd\n                              as \u03c32\n                                  1, \u2225AH\n                                       i Y\u22252\n                                            F follows the\nnon-central \u03c72 distribution with 2dK degrees of freedom, and its\nnoncentrality parameter \u03bb can be calculated as 2dKM2g2\n\n\u03c32\n1\n, which is similar to the proof in Appendix A. Compared to the previous proof in Appendix A, the difficulty of this theorem lies in the higher degree of freedom of the non-central \u03c72 distributions.\n\nActually, when the degree of freedom in non-central \u03c72 distributions is larger than 2, an additional complicated coefficient will appear in its characteristic function, which can not be solved by the characteristic function method as the proof given in (29)\n[29]. As a result, we need to approximate the non-central \u03c72\ndistributed \u2225AiY\u22252\nF when Xi \u0338= 0 into a more generalized form.\n\nAccording to [28], the non-central \u03c72 distribution can be approximated to a central \u03c72 distribution through Patnaik's second moment approximation, i.e.,\n\n$$\\chi^{\\prime2}(n,\\lambda)\\approx\\rho\\chi(\\tau),\\tag{52}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\\rho=\\frac{n+2\\lambda}{n+\\lambda}=\\frac{2dK+\\frac{4dKM^{2}g^{2}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}}}{2dK+\\frac{2dKM^{2}g^{2}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}}},\\tag{53}$$\n\n$$\\tau=\\frac{(n+\\lambda)^{2}}{n+2\\lambda}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{2dK+\\frac{2dKM^{2}g^{2}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}}}{2dK+\\frac{4dKM^{2}g^{2}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}}}\\right)^{2}}{2dK+\\frac{4dKM^{2}g^{2}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}}}.$$\nRecall that central \u03c72 distribution is a special case of Gamma distribution, we obtain that\n\n$$\\|\\mathbf{A}_{i}^{\\mathrm{H}}\\mathbf{Y}\\|_{F}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}\\chi^{\\prime2}(2dK,\\lambda)\\tag{54}$$ $$\\approx\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{1}^{2}\\rho\\chi^{2}(\\tau)$$ $$=\\Gamma\\Big{(}\\frac{\\tau}{2},\\frac{1}{\\rho\\sigma_{1}^{2}}\\Big{)}.$$\n\nWhen $\\mathbf{X}_{i}=\\mathbf{0}$, we can similarly obtain the distribution of $\\mathbf{A}_{i}\\mathbf{Y}$ as follows.\n\n$$\\mathbf{A}_{i}^{\\mathrm{H}}\\mathbf{Y}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathcal{CN}(0,M)_{d\\times d}\\mathbf{X}_{t}+\\mathcal{CN}(0,M\\sigma^{2})_{d\\times K}\\tag{55}$$ $$=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathcal{CN}(0,dMg^{2})_{d\\times K}+\\mathcal{CN}(0,M\\sigma^{2})_{d\\times K}$$ $$=\\mathcal{CN}(0,M(Sdg^{2}+\\sigma^{2}))_{d\\times K}.$$\n\n  Let \u03c32\n       2 = M(Sdg2 + \u03c32). As a result, the distribution of\n\u2225AH\n   i Y\u22252\n       F can be expressed as a Gamma distribution in the shape-\nrate form, i.e.,\n\n$$\\|{\\bf A}_{i}^{\\rm H}{\\bf Y}\\|_{F}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{2}^{2}\\chi^{2}(2dK)=\\Gamma\\Big{(}dK,\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{2}^{2}}\\Big{)}.\\tag{56}$$\nAfter obtaining the probability distribution of \u2225AH\ni Y\u22252\nF in different cases, the optimal prior factor v(pi), which minimizes the error probability, is solved similar to that in Appendix A.\n\nLet \u03b11 = \u03c4\n2, \u03b21 =\n1\n\u03c1\u03c32\n1 and \u03b12 = dK, \u03b22 =\n1\n\u03c32\n2 , then \u2225AH\ni Y\u22252\nF\nfollows the distribution of \u0393(\u03b11, \u03b21) and \u0393(\u03b12, \u03b22) when Xi = 0\nand Xi \u0338= 0, respectively. Define v1, v2, T1, T2, \u2206v, \u2206p, pi as the same in Theorem 1. The PDF of T = T1 \u2212 T2 still needs to be derived.\n\nAccording to [30], the PDF of T , which is the difference between two Gamma distributions, can be written as\n\n$$p_{T}(t)=\\begin{cases}\\frac{\\tilde{c}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_{1})}t^{\\frac{\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2}}{2}-1}e^{\\frac{\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1}}{2}t}\\\\ \\frac{W_{\\frac{\\alpha_{1}-\\alpha_{2}}{2}},1-\\alpha_{1}-\\alpha_{2}}{\\tilde{c}}\\left((\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2})t\\right)\\qquad t\\geq0,\\\\ \\frac{\\tilde{c}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_{2})}(-t)^{\\frac{\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2}}{2}-1}e^{\\frac{\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1}}{2}t}\\\\ W_{\\frac{\\alpha_{2}-\\alpha_{1}}{2},\\frac{1-\\alpha_{1}-\\alpha_{2}}{2}}\\left(-(\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2})t\\right)\\quad t<0,\\end{cases}\\tag{57}$$\n\nwhere \u02dcc =\n               \u03b2\u03b11\n                1\n                  \u03b2\u03b12\n                  2\n\n(\u03b21+\u03b22)(\u03b11+\u03b12)/2 is a scalar, \u0393(x) represents the Gamma function, and W\u03ba,\u00b5(z) is the Whittaker function [31], which is the solution for the following differential equation\n\n$$\\frac{d^{2}w}{dz^{2}}+\\Big{(}-\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{\\kappa}{z}+\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}-\\mu^{2}}{z^{2}}\\Big{)}w=0.\\tag{58}$$\n\nBased on Theorem 1, the derivative of error probability $\\frac{\\partial P_{\\alpha}}{\\partial v}$\n\u2202v when \u2206v > 0 is given by\n\n\u03b22\u2212\u03b21 \u03b11+\u03b12 2 \u22121e 2 \u2206v\u00d7 \u2202Pe \u2202v =pi1(1 \u2212 pi2) \u02dcc \u0393(\u03b11)(\u2206v) W \u03b11\u2212\u03b12 2 , \u03b11+\u03b12\u22121 (59) \u03b11+\u03b12 2 \ufffd (\u03b21 + \u03b22)\u2206v \ufffd 2 \u22121e\u2212 \u03b22\u2212\u03b21 2 \u2206v\u00d7 \u2212 pi2(1 \u2212 pi1) \u02dcc \u0393(\u03b12)(\u2206v) W \u03b12\u2212\u03b11 2 , \u03b11+\u03b12\u22121 2 \ufffd (\u03b21 + \u03b22)\u2206v \ufffd .\nIn (59), we use the property of W\u03ba,\u2212\u00b5(z) = W\u03ba,\u00b5(z) for Whittaker functions [31]. From [31], the Whittaker function has a concise estimation, i.e.,\n\nW\u03ba,\u00b5(z) = \u0393(2\u00b5) \u0393( 1 2 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03ba)z 1 2 \u2212\u00b5, (60)\nwhen \u211c(\u00b5) = \u03b11+\u03b12\u22121\n2\n> 1\n2 and z = (\u03b21 + \u03b22)\u2206v \u2192 0, which is naturally satisfied in (59) since \u03b11, \u03b12 > 1 and \u2206v \u2192 0. By leveraging (60) and letting \u2202Pe\n\nleveraging (60) and letting $\\frac{\\partial P_{x}}{\\partial v}=0$, (59) can be finally expressed by\n\n$$e^{(\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1})\\Delta v}=\\frac{p_{i_{2}}(1-p_{i_{1}})}{p_{i_{1}}(1-p_{i_{2}})},\\tag{61}$$\nwhere pi2 (1\u2212pi1 )\npi1 (1\u2212pi2 ) = 1 +\n\u2206p pi(1\u2212pi) since \u2206p \u2192 0, which has been demonstrated in Appendix A.\n\nTherefore, since \u2206p \u2192 0, \u2206v can be expressed as\n\n$$\\begin{split}\\Lambda v&=\\frac{1}{\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1}}\\ln(1+\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_{i}(1-p_{i})})\\\\ &\\approx\\frac{1}{\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1}}\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_{i}(1-p_{i})}.\\end{split}\\tag{62}$$\nBased on (62), the derivative of v(pi) can be obtained, which finally gives the expression of v(pi), i.e.,\n\n$$v(p_{i})=\\frac{1}{\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1}}\\ln\\biggl{(}\\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}\\biggr{)}.\\tag{63}$$\nBy denoting\n1\n\nBy denoting $\\frac{1}{\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1}}$ as coefficient $D$, the optimal form of $v(p_{i})$ in (2) is therefore acquired.\n\nFor the case where $\\Delta v<0$, (63) can be obtained by similar deductions. This completes the whole proof.\n"
