## Abstract

South Africa is currently facing a cri�cal situa�on in its power genera�on landscape, which is plagued by frequent power outages and the need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. This period emphasizes the importance of having firm-dispatchable power to balance out the intermitent nature of wind and solar energy sources. The paper proposes to repurpose old coal-fired power plants to generate firm-dispatchable energy in line with the principles of a Just Transi�on. Eskom's coal plants are approaching the end of their economic life, and their declining energy availability factor is becoming a challenge in mee�ng the country's energy needs. The study suggests that a comprehensive strategy that integrates wind, solar, and firm-dispatchable power can be cost-effec�ve and reliable compared to the tradi�onal coal-based approach or the nuclear alterna�ve. The study emphasizes the necessity of a 25-
year plan that would invest in flexible and modular dispatchable genera�on. It also highlights the strategic loca�on of this genera�ng capacity, including repurposing decommissioned coal plant sites. The proposed model integrates private investment, adheres to established best prac�ces, and emphasizes adaptability to changing demand dynamics. The study provides a roadmap for enabling firm-dispatchable capacity for South Africa's energy transi�on, emphasizing economic prudence, environmental sustainability, and alignment with the principles of the Just Transi�on program. 

## Introduc�On

South Africa is shi�ing from a power genera�on system that relies on fossil fuels to one based on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. This transi�on is mo�vated by the need to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and is also becoming a more cost-effec�ve op�on (Creamer, 2023). 

Furthermore, the government has stated that this transi�on should be carried out within the framework of the Just Transi�on program where the transi�on is done in a manner that preserves employment in affected areas (Govt of South Africa, 2023).  
Wind and solar energy sources are known for their variability, so there must be a provision of firmdispatchable power to meet the demand when these sources cannot. A program for firm-dispatchable power must be implemented to successfully transi�on to a renewable energy system that relies on variable sources (Clark & McGregor, 2024). South Africa's current genera�on system is not mee�ng its needs, and the situa�on will likely worsen as base load facili�es con�nue to age and must be replaced. This review summarises the current genera�on system and considers the implementa�on of the necessary firmdispatchable genera�on system. Repurposing current baseload coal genera�on plants as poten�al loca�ons for developing firm-dispatchable genera�on facili�es is proposed. 

## Background

Eskom is the sole electricity provider in South Africa, genera�ng most of its power from fi�een coal-fired plants that operate constantly (Eskom, n.d.). As of 2023, the average age of these plants was 36 years. 

According to interna�onal experience, coal-fired power plants usually have an average maximum economic lifespan of 46 years (Cui et al., 2019). Eskom plans their plants to last for 50 years, so many of them are nearing the end of their useful lives and will soon need to be decommissioned (Department of Energy, 2011). Of the 39.8 GW total of installed coal-fired plants, Eskom an�cipates decommissioning 28 GW in the next 15 years and nearly 35 GW in the next 25 years, as illustrated in Figure 1 (Futuregrowth Asset Management, 2021). It has been observed globally that thermal plants have a decreasing average capacity factor as they get older. This factor is called the Energy Availability Factor (EAF) in South Africa. In the last two decades, the EAF for the South African genera�on fleet has decreased from 80% to 53%, as indicated in Figure 2 (Pierce 
& le Roux, 2023). The Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) created since 2010 assumed an increase the EAF of these plants to meet growing energy demands (Department of Energy, 2019). However, experience has shown that this is unlikely to happen, and the fleet's performance will con�nue to decline un�l each plant becomes financially unviable. A study conducted in the USA by the Na�onal Energy Technology Laboratory 
(NETL), which analysed the performance of over 300 coal plants in the USA, has shown that the performance of ageing plants declines just as experienced by the South African fleet, as illustrated in Figure 
3 (Kern, 2015). 

 
It is important to note that older power plants face numerous challenges in addi�on to maintaining their performance. They also produce harmful pollutants during coal combus�on, which can cause serious health problems to people exposed to power sta�on emissions (Bloomberg, 2023). To address this issue, significant modifica�ons are required to reduce pollu�on, which can be expensive. However, due to the need for power genera�on and the high cost of these modifica�ons, most of the Eskom plants have been granted exemp�ons from installing the required pollu�on control (Bloomberg, 2023). In the latest proposed IRP, more exemp�ons have been requested (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 
2024). These license-to-operate concerns may ul�mately lead to some non-compliant plants being forced to shut down before they reach their expected 50-year lifespan. 

South Africa has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Accord, as have most other countries worldwide (UNFCCC, 2015). As part of the South African government's plan, the country has commited to phasing out coal-fuelled power plants to meet these commitments 
(UNFCCC, n.d.). In addi�on to the economic reasons for discon�nuing the use of these aging facili�es, mee�ng these commitments will also put pressure on the country to decommission these plants and replace them with low or zero greenhouse gas-emi�ng sources of electricity. While recognising the need to close out the large coal fuelled genera�on plants, the government is cognisant of the effect that these plants closure will have on local employment (Govt of South Africa, 2023). These plants are major sources of employment in their respec�ve loca�ons, with jobs in the plants plus mining and related jobs associated with fuelling these plants with local coal. To minimise the impact on these communi�es, the government has mandated that the transi�on be conducted within the framework of a "Just Transi�on" where jobs are maintained as much as possible and where-ever possible new jobs created in those loca�ons. This must be a part of the planning for any renewable based system. One of the major ques�ons that is always present in any forecast for power genera�on requirements is the forecas�ng of the demand profile. In 1990, a study on electricity forecas�ng in the USA stated (Hobbs 
& Maheshwari, 1990): 
"Planning decisions are severely affected by uncertainties in demand. This fact has two implications: accurate forecasts of demand are worth more than forecasts of other parameters, and the expected cost of ignoring demand uncertainties exceeds the cost of disregarding other sources of risk."  
In the past, it was believed that the demand for electricity would grow at a rate roughly equal to the growth in GDP in the area being served (Sharma, Smeets & Tryggestad, 2019). However, over the last 15 
years, the power genera�on from the central power provider in South Africa has been decreasing steadily. On average, demand has been decreasing by 0.5% per year, and this rate of decrease appears to be increasing, as illustrated in Figure 4 (Pierce & le Roux, 2023). This trend is likely due to several factors, including the adop�on of energy-efficient technologies such as LED ligh�ng, the conversion of heavy energy users to less intense energy opera�ons, and the rise in self-genera�on (such as behind-the-meter solar installa�ons). While some argue that the rapid electrifica�on of major power uses, such as the growth of the electric vehicle market, will reverse this trend and lead to large increases in power demand, there is a significant uncertainty about the future demand (Merven, 2023). Therefore, any plan to address future electricity demand must be flexible enough to adapt to uncertainty and changes in demand growth. Building baseload genera�on plants to meet unknown demand is challenging because of the �me required to construct these plants and the economies of scale associated the size of the plants. This can result in either a capacity under build, which leads to unserved demand, or an over build, which results in higher costs.  
 

## 

In June 2023, the South African Presiden�al Climate Commission (PCC) released its recommenda�ons on South Africa's electricity system. The report suggested that a least-cost approach to genera�ng electricity would require a significant increase in the construc�on of renewable energy sources supported by batery storage and *gas peakers* (Creamer, 2023). This transi�on to renewable energy sources is also being embraced globally, and many countries are rapidly increasing their wind and solar genera�on capacity. Numerous studies conducted by the CSIR, and other ins�tu�ons, have corroborated the findings of the PCC report, which advocates for a least-cost system based on renewable energy sources (Bischof-Niemz, 
2017; Roy, Sinha & Shah, 2020). However, there is a subtle yet significant difference in conclusion: the requirement is for *firm-dispatchable* power instead of *peaking* power (Clark & McGregor, 2024).  
These studies have shown that even with the lowest cost genera�on system, it is s�ll essen�al to have installed firm-dispatchable genera�on capacity to meet the system's needs during �mes when wind and solar power are unable to meet demand. This period of low renewable resources could happen for several days each year, and in some years, it could be for periods of several weeks (Clark, Van Niekerk & Petrie, 
2020). This requirement was tested in models of the South Africa grid and models of the Texas and UK 
grids, which all showed similar results (Clark & McGregor, 2024). It is not a replacement for base load genera�on but would be u�lised less than 10% of the �me and must always be available. Opera�ng baseload plants with this low u�lisa�on rate would be expensive due to the high capital cost of thermal plants (Bergh & Delarue, 2015). Interna�onal experience has shown that using the baseload plants in cycling mode reduces their expected lifespan by adding fa�gue stress to elements of the plant that are not designed for this mode of opera�on (Kumar et al., 2012; Nichols, 2016). 

## Size, Cost And Timing

As men�oned earlier and illustrated in past analyses, it is necessary to have firm-dispatchable power genera�on available to fully support the por�on of the total power genera�on that is being supplied by variable sources such as wind and solar. In other words, this firm-dispatchable power genera�on must be installed to completely subs�tute the volume of base load power that is being decommissioned, and it must be done at the same pace as the decommissioning process (Clark & McGregor, 2024). There is also a need to provide firm-dispatchable genera�on to complement the variable sources of genera�on (wind and solar) that have already been installed on the grid. 

The current demand from the Eskom grid is 222 TWh per year, with a peak demand of 35 GW and an average of 25 GW over the year. Table 1 shows the sources of genera�on in the current system (Pierce & 
le Roux, 2023). As men�oned earlier, coal is the primary genera�on source, but the capacity factor of the coal fleet is low.

Fi�een coal-fired power plants are currently installed with a total rated electricity capacity of 39.8 GW. 

The power plants have different capaci�es, ranging from 990 MW to 4.8 GW, with an average size of 2.6 GW (Eskom, n.d.) The fleet's overall age is 36 years from the commissioning date. However, two recently built plants contribute nearly a quarter of the installed capacity, 9.6 GW out of the total 39.8 GW capacity 
(Eskom, n.d.). Without the two new plants, the rest of the fleet has an age range from 22 to 57 years and an average age of 41. Eskom has planned a decommissioning schedule as indicated above in Figure 1.  
The output for the nuclear plant located at Koeberg has dropped from approximately 85% in 2016 to the current EAF in the range of 65%, according to repor�ng from Eskom. This EAF decrease for Koeberg is shown in Figure 5 (Eskom, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023). This plant has recently undergone a major refurbishment and will remain opera�onal un�l 2044. It is expected that this plant will have reached its economic life at that �me and will be decommissioned near the end of the planning period. Hydropower facili�es generally have a longer life expectancy than thermal power plants (US Dept. of Energy, 2003). The 0.6 GW of hydro genera�on and 2.7 GW of pumped storage should be available throughout the current planning term un�l 2050. Assuming the 35 GW of current baseload genera�on needs to be replaced with equivalent plants, this would mean construc�ng 25 GW of coal plants or nuclear (with an assumed 70% EAF) over the next twenty-five years. That is, on average, a capacity of 1000 MW is added annually. This assumes that the demand profile remains the same but with enough genera�on installed to eliminate load shedding. According to the US EIA capital cost es�mates, shown in Figure 6, and detailed in Table 2, this would require an investment of USD 171 billion for these new coal power plants (US EIA, 2023). For nuclear, the capital cost would be slightly more, at $185 billion USD. However, the expected �ming to build new baseload plants and the experience from the last two plants built in South Africa suggest a construc�on �me of over 14 years, which means that this program is years behind what would be required (World Bank, 2023). This is a completely unrealis�c scenario.

## 

The previous "business as usual" scenarios can be compared with a renewable-based genera�on system that mostly relies on wind and solar power. At the end of the 25-year planning period, this renewable system is expected to retain 12.9 GW of baseload, while wind and solar will replace all the decommissioned genera�on. The remaining baseload genera�on will come from the newly built coalfuelled plants (Medupi and Kusile) and hydropower, which only need to be replaced beyond the end of the planning period. Based on the current demand profile, the model indicates that 49 GW of new wind and 14 GW of new u�lity solar will be required, plus 24 GWh of new Batery storage, with 15 GW of new firm-dispatchable genera�on required with an expected u�lisa�on of 5%. The total capital cost for this system over the next twenty-five years would be 145 billion USD based on the US EIA 2023 cost es�mates 
(US EIA, 2023). The costs for this alternate renewable based system are detailed in Table 2. 

One of the major advantages of the new wind and solar-based system is that it saves on fuel costs. 

Currently, the 176 TWh of genera�on from the coal fleet costs approximately 2.2 billion USD per year in fuel expenses, assuming coal costs approximately 100 USD per ton (GlobalEconomy.com, 2024). Once the coal-fuelled plants are decommissioned, some fuel will s�ll be required to run the firm-dispatchable power. Assuming a 20 USD per GJ fuel, the cost of fuel for the 9 TWh of genera�on expected from these plants (compared to the current system's 3.6 TWh) would have an addi�onal cost of 750 million USD. Therefore, elimina�ng the older coal genera�on plants would result in a fuel savings of approximately 75%, or over 1.7 billion USD annually. The fuel cost for the firm-dispatchable genera�on should be kept to a minimum, only using what is needed to keep the system balanced. Based on these calcula�ons, it has been determined that a renewable-based genera�on system would require over 30 billion USD less in capital cost than the tradi�onal business-as-usual system in addi�on to the expected annual fuel savings of 1.7 billion USD. Therefore, the cost of power genera�on from the renewable system in the next 20 years would be 25% less expensive than that of a coal-based system. The renewable system would also produce significantly less pollu�on and minimal greenhouse gas emissions.  
The system's reduced development schedule and modular investments also make it more responsive to changes in demand forecasts. As can be seen from the range of sizes for the coal plants in South Africa of 900 MW to 4800 MW with the two new plants at the top of this size, coal plants are generally built on large sizes to take advantage of economies of scale. This is considering loca�ons near fuel sources as well as efficiency of the plant (Jan Van Helden & Muysken, 1981). These plants also take many years to construct. The two new coal plants in South Africa took 14 years from approval to commissioning. The World Bank indicates that coal plants take 10 to 12 years from financial close to comple�on, while renewable energy projects have a construc�on �me of less than 2 years (World Bank, 2023). The peaking plants in South Africa are in sizes from 120 MW up to 1300 MW consis�ng of combus�on engine plants and open cycle gas turbines (OCGT). These technologies can be built modularly as needed, and their construc�on �mes is less than three years. The 140 MW combus�on engine power plant at Sasolburg was constructed in 15 month (Sasol, 2013) . Eskom constructed both the 1327 MW Ankerlig and 740 MW 
Gourikwa OCGT plants within two years (Eskom, 2014). Combus�on engine and fuel cell plants are usually built with units of up to 10 MW, while OCGT plants can be built with units of up to several hundred MW. 

Turbine generators require some de-ra�ng when installed at al�tude and high ambient temperatures as in the High Veldt. Combus�on engine plants might be preferred at these condi�ons (Clark, 2016). Genera�on plants can be made with mul�-units, with expected plant sizes ranging from 100 to 1500 MW. While coal plants are generally �ed to their fuel source, there is not a direct need for peaking plants to be �ed to a fuel source. With low capital cost, modular sizing, short construc�on �me and not being �ed to a specific loca�on, these firm-dispatchable plants add to a flexible program. 

## Program Flexibility

As noted in the introduc�on, demand forecasts are one of the most significant factors in having an op�mal development program. However, this is one of the most difficult parameters to es�mate. Figure 7 shows the history of the demand curve in South Africa for the last fi�een years and current growth forecast. This fi�een years is the period where the country has been working on implemen�ng the IRP program. 

According to the forecast from the 2010 IRP, the demand for 2022 should have been 385 TWh per year, nearly twice the actual 2022 genera�on of 220 TWh (Department of Energy, 2011; Pierce & le Roux, 2023). 

The 2010 forecast demand would have required that over 30 GW of new genera�on should have been added to the system by now. With Eskom unable to meet the actual demand, it is quite fortunate that the 2010 forecast was not what happened.  
The actual trend has been consistently downward at 0.5% per year on average. The demand over the last fi�een years has decreased by over 10%. Even with this decrease, Eskom has not been able to supply the demand and load shedding has increased significantly. These numbers lay out the financial consequences of demand changes not being as forecast. If the forecast had been followed an addi�onal 30 GW of baseload genera�on should have been installed by now, with all its addi�onal costs. However, no addi�onal base load except for the two new coal plants that had been in the plan prior to commencement of the IRP.  Only a minimal amount of renewable genera�on was constructed, 3.4 GW of wind and 2.8 GW 
of solar, since the IRP program started, with no associated firm-dispatchable genera�on. This has not offset the loss of over 8 GW of base load genera�on due to performance degrada�on from the installed fleet. 

The cost of this underbuilding has been increased load shedding, with the associated indirect costs. 

While no plan can withstand a "no ac�on" plan, a development based on wind, solar, bateries and firmdispatchable genera�on offers the best chance to recover from past inac�on and to meet whatever the actual demand will be. The forecast for demand should be a range that commences from the current downward trend, to what is in the current IRP. The ac�on plan should be developing a program that can meet any demand within this range. With the short two-year development �mes for wind, solar, bateries and firm-dispatchable genera�on, plus their modularity, this flexibility is reasonable. 


## Firm-Dispatchable Genera�On Program

It is an�cipated that the demand for electricity genera�on will change through the 25-year planning cycle, and the economics of opera�ng coal plants may affect the decommissioning program. However, it is essen�al to plan the development of firm-dispatchable genera�on, with a target of construc�ng 15 GW of new capacity over the next 25 years, or approximately 0.75 GW per year. This will cost around 650 million USD annually, less than 10% of the total investment program. Immediate implementa�on of this program is necessary to meet the current impact of load shedding which is an�cipated to last through 2027 
according to the latest IRP (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2024). This addi�on of genera�on should be done to keep the total Eskom firm capacity at a minimum of 35 GW assuming that the demand remains at the current level.  
In a report in 2018, the CSIR calculated that the immediate need for addi�onal firm-dispatchable power was over 5 GW at that �me (Wright, Calitz & Kamera, 2018). As the base load genera�on fleet performance has con�nued to deteriorate since that analysis, the current shor�all for firm-dispatchable genera�on is over 10 GW. A�er the current shor�all is overcome, the implementa�on schedule can be adjusted as changes arise in the demand profile, decommissioning program, and wind and solar energy implementa�on.  
Firm-dispatchable power genera�on requires specific technology performance parameters, which include fast ramp rates. This can be achieved with internal combus�on engine (ICE) plants, gas turbines (OCGT or CCGT), and fuel cells. Currently, both combus�on engine and OCGT plants are used in the country. Fuel cells are more expensive, but they have higher efficiency. With further development, the technology is expected to eventually become economically compe��ve. These technologies can use various fuels, including natural gas, LPG, diesel, biofuel, and clean hydrogen. The choice of fuel is generally based on the delivered cost, which must include the logis�cs cost of delivery to the plant and the seasonal storage costs to keep fuel volumes sufficient to run the plant for several days. With the range of poten�al fuels and the ability to deliver them to most loca�ons, the si�ng for firm-dispatchable genera�on is not �ed to its fuel source as much as coal-fuelled plants, typically built at coal mine loca�ons to minimise fuel transport. Due to its convenience in usage from easy delivery and storage, Eskom has tradi�onally used diesel for its peaking plants. However, diesel is an expensive choice and the budget for this fuel has become a major issue for Eskom. Going forward, Eskom is likely to switch to alternate fuels where-ever possible to reduce costs. The choices could be natural gas, LPG or biofuels.  
In South Africa, natural gas is not an ideal choice for dispatchable power due to the lack of local produc�on and limited distribu�on infrastructure, unlike in Europe or North America (Clark et al., 2022). Currently, natural gas is available through the Rompco pipeline in eastern part of South Africa. However, the gas fields supplying the Rompco pipeline are approaching the end of their life, making it difficult to plan around this supply (Creamer, 2019). Natural gas importa�on facili�es in the form of LNG terminals or pipeline gas are quite capital-intensive. Natural gas would only become a reasonable alterna�ve if other gas markets developed to support its importa�on, which is considered unlikely by several studies (Clark et al., 2022). 

Storage of natural gas at the loca�on of the genera�on plant is also a challenge that must be addressed. LPG has been recommended as an alterna�ve fuel for Ankerlig and might be a reasonable choice for most plant loca�ons (Clark, McGregor & Van Niekerk, 2022). As this fuel historically has been about 60% of the price of diesel fuel on the interna�onal market, it could be an economically atrac�ve choice. This fuel does have the convenience of being a liquid fuel like diesel at nominal pressure and temperature, with related convenience of delivery and storage. This is a fuel that could be immediately used and will likely be less expensive to import and use than LNG will be.  
The choice of fuel can change over �me. As the use of these plants is intended to be minimised, greenhouse gas emissions from these plants are a lower priority for most systems. Over �me, these plants must shi� to zero-emission fuels such as hydrogen, ammonia, or biofuel.  

## Loca�Ons

Firm-dispatchable genera�on can be installed in loca�ons that maximise its value within the system. This generally implies si�ng these plants close to major load centres and in places where the grid can handle the input without major changes. 

The loca�on of firm-dispatchable power genera�on should be chosen based on where it can provide the most value to the power grid at the lowest cost. This can be based on economic or social factors, among other considera�ons. The "Just Transi�on" concept is a part of government policy that aims to minimize disrup�ons to current employment paterns during the energy transi�on (Govt of South Africa, 2023). Therefore, it is important to consider this concept when selec�ng the loca�on for firm-dispatchable power genera�on. 

One possible solu�on for placing firm-dispatchable genera�on plants that meet social and economic parameters for maximum value is to construct them at the sites of decommissioned coal-fired power plants. This can be achieved by removing the base load genera�on plant while retaining the substa�on and grid connec�on. The new firm-dispatchable genera�on plant can then be built at the former base load plant loca�on, in a size that is deemed suitable. From a grid integra�on perspec�ve these sites are expected to have a mostly posi�ve impact on the grid and minimal nega�ve consequences. The infrastructure already in place at these loca�ons makes it easy to integrate power into the grid, allowing for firm genera�on replacement up to the capacity of the decommissioned coal plant. As a result, there should be no doubt about the grid's ability to handle this power input, given the exis�ng grid connec�on. From an economic perspec�ve, these loca�ons offer two advantages: minimized grid connec�on costs due to the use of exis�ng connec�ons, and construc�on on an exis�ng site. One of the major costs and �me factors in building any power plant is in the permi�ng process. Environmental and social parameters must be studied in detail for any new construc�on. Building on the site of an exis�ng opera�on will minimize this cost and �me. Elimina�ng the coal plant will have a posi�ve impact on the environment by reducing pollu�on and improving the health of the community. However, the use of any new fossil fuel in the genera�on of dispatchable power may s�ll result in some greenhouse gas and pollu�on emissions. These emissions will be far less than those produced by the original coal-fuelled power sta�on. With eventual conversion of the fuel to green hydrogen, derived from excess renewable genera�on, these emissions can be eliminated. To maximize the value of the firm-dispatchable genera�on and eliminate the emissions from the plant, it should be feasible to co-locate a hydrogen produc�on and storage on the site of the former base load plant. This should maximize the value of the plant for the net-zero grid. 

From the perspec�ve of the Just Transi�on, repurposing former baseload power plant sites to firmdispatchable power can help minimize the impact on local employment. The skill sets required to operate the new plant are similar to those used in the opera�on of the coal power sta�on, requiring only minimal retraining. Employment related to the supply of coal to the plant will be eliminated with the decommissioning of the exis�ng plant in any scenario. However, there will be some employment opportuni�es created with the fuel supply for the new plant. While decommissioning any major baseload plant will cause significant employment disrup�ons, using the site for some of the required firmdispatchable genera�on can help reduce this impact. 

## Comparison Case

South Africa is not the only loca�on that is going through the energy transi�on. Many u�lity operators are considering the repurposing of baseload plants as firm-dispatchable genera�on to facilitate the energy transi�on (World Bank Group, 2021; Henkel, 2023). One recent example is the rebuilding of a 95-year-old power plant in the US state of Florida, renamed the "Dania Beach Clean Energy Center". Florida Power and Light, the plant's operator, plans to rebuild it as a firm-dispatchable plant with two OCGTs with each genera�ng 580 MW. The operator has stated that this repurposed plant will become a major factor in support of the rapid deployment of solar genera�on in their system (Florida Power and Light, n.d.). They have also indicated that the plant can be converted to hydrogen fuel when it becomes economically viable. The Florida plant will be upgraded by completely replacing the old plant with a new one at the same loca�on. A photograph of the original plant built in 1927 is shown in Figure 8. The new firm-dispatchable energy plant will replace a base load gas plant that was built at the same loca�on in the 1990s. Computer renderings from the operator of the exis�ng gas plant and the new plant can be seen in Figures 9 and 10 
(Florida Power and Light, n.d.). This approach can also be implemented at the baseload coal power sta�ons in the Eskom system. 

  
 

## Implemen�Ng The Firm-Dispatchable Genera�On Program

The Climate Council has recommended a transi�on program to develop wind and solar resources 
(Creamer, 2023). However, this program should also include the installa�on of firm-dispatchable genera�on (Clark & McGregor, 2024). It is recommended that reputable private investors be involved in this program to meet the required deployment at a reasonable cost for the South African public. This program should be structured properly, consistent with the best prac�ces the REIPPP Program, and commence immediately to contribute to load-shedding elimina�on in the short-term but also in a manner that is consistent with long-term needs and the Just Transi�on program.  
The steps in this implanta�on can generally be described as follows. 

## 1. Set Up Investment Model

The first step is to develop the financial and bidding model for implemen�ng a firm-dispatchable genera�on program. Private investment must be encouraged to build these plants with the understanding that they are intended to be u�lized as litle as possible. This would most likely indicate a capacity payment system for guaranteed available power plus a use fee that would cover the fuel and variable opera�ng and maintenance costs associated with the plants use. The primary payback from the system should be associated with having the capacity available rather than its use.  

## 2. General Engineering Of The Si�Ng And Schedule Of The Developments

 The second step would be the general engineering and si�ng analysis for the base program as well as the development for a priority development schedule. It is clear from the Eskom coal plant decommissioning program that three of the plants are currently due, or overdue, for decommissioning. The first step should be the repurposing of these sites by replacing the plant. 

The remaining plant replacements will occur as the other plants are decommissioned. While the loca�ons of the exis�ng plants will provide loca�on for some of the required firm-dispatchable genera�on, there will be other loca�ons near load centres that also offer advantages that must be considered.  
 

3. Bidding for developments 
 With the overall financial model developed, the bidding for specific plant developments would be the next step in the process. The successful REIPPP program would be a reasonable star�ng point for the development of the bidding for these plants. 

 

4. Installa�on and opera�on of plants  
 Once the bidding process is in place, it would be up to the private investors to build out the required plants. This would likely involve comple�ng the approval process, the removal of the exis�ng plant, the installa�on and commissioning of the new plant as well as the opera�on of the plant once commissioned. 

 

5. Monitoring of the need for modifica�ons to the schedule and implementa�on 
 One of the advantages of this program compared to the development program for baseload genera�on is the ability to adapt the program to meet changing need. A monitoring program should be in place to adapt the program as required during its implementa�on. 

6. Engineering analysis of conversion to zero-emission fuels 
Eventually, these plants must be part of a net zero genera�on system and as such, there must be an engineering program to make the conversions of these plants to zero emission fuels. This could take the form of hydrogen generated from the excess renewable genera�on or poten�ally from biofuels. Neither of these conversions should be technically difficult and should not affect the development or use of these facili�es. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this research underscores the cri�cal need for expedi�ng a firm-dispatchable genera�on program within South Africa's evolving energy landscape. The imminent decommissioning of ageing coalfired plants, coupled with the uncertain future demand for energy as well as the na�on's commitment to a Just Transi�on, necessitates a strategic shi� towards renewable sources supported by firm-dispatchable power. The proposed 25-year plan, emphasising modular technologies and repurposing decommissioned coal plant sites, offers a cost-effec�ve and environmentally sound alterna�ve to the tradi�onal rigid coalcentric paradigm. The integra�on of private investors, drawing inspira�on from global case studies, and adherence to established best prac�ces enhance the feasibility and adaptability of the recommended approach. The envisaged program addresses immediate challenges and lays the founda�on for a sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure that aligns with global impera�ves and the principles of a Just Transi�on.
